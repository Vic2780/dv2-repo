    <ScenarioTalk1_1>The Forest of Hope is a safe region suited for a novice explorer!</ScenarioTalk1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk1_2>But many monsters from the forest have come down to the village...</ScenarioTalk1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk1_3>The number of monsters has been increasing ever since the War of Light and Darkness.</ScenarioTalk1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk1_4>Why are the monsters coming to our village?</ScenarioTalk1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk1_5>Hmm... maybe they are scared of something...</ScenarioTalk1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk1_6>Scared?</ScenarioTalk1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk1_7>Well... maybe of evil monster who is stronger than them...</ScenarioTalk1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk1_8>Hmmm... something stronger... That is a scary thought.</ScenarioTalk1_8>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk2_1>Ahhhhh! Look at this!! I found an egg in the corner!</ScenarioTalk2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk2_2>I am 100% sure that this is a Boulder Dragon Egg!</ScenarioTalk2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk2_3>A Boulder Dragon Egg... Awesome, I don't have him in my dragon book!</ScenarioTalk2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk2_4>Hehehe. It's my lucky day!</ScenarioTalk2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk2_5>You can discover Dragon Eggs through adventures...&#10;Most dragon habitats match their characteristics!</ScenarioTalk2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk2_6>So! This means that you can locate your desired Dragon Eggs by checking&#10;the dragon's Element, and exploring the regions known for that Element!</ScenarioTalk2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk2_7>Anyway... If you want to become the best Dragon Tamer!</ScenarioTalk2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk2_8>Collect as many Dragon Eggs as possible and train them!</ScenarioTalk2_8>
    
    <ScenarioTalk2_9>Sor... sorry. I forgot to tell you something!</ScenarioTalk2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk2_10>- Nuri looked shocked and was gasping for breath. -</ScenarioTalk2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk2_11>Remember that incident when the monsters invaded Elpis?</ScenarioTalk2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk2_12>Ah... you are going to ask to scout around the Forest of Hope, right?</ScenarioTalk2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk2_13>- Nuri nodded vigorously as if he was waiting for Jimon to talk. -</ScenarioTalk2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk2_14>Yup! I've already told Kanggalo that I'll be going, and then I forgot!</ScenarioTalk2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk2_15>I'm not surprised....</ScenarioTalk2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk2_16>Humph! You didn't even know!</ScenarioTalk2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk2_17>I knew! Just didn't show it!</ScenarioTalk2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk2_18>Yea... I'm sure! Well... let's go and investigate the Forest of Hope.</ScenarioTalk2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk2_19>And let's ignore that well expressive someone over there!</ScenarioTalk2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk2_20>I think it will be sufficient if we explore the Forest of Hope %1$s times! Let's be on our way!</ScenarioTalk2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk2_21>What the... hey... wait for me!</ScenarioTalk2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk2_22>Well... we did our best in scouting the area. Even Kanggalo will not scream down our throat this time!</ScenarioTalk2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk2_23>Tired, right? Let's go back and get some rest!</ScenarioTalk2_23>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk3_1>Oh! Welcome! Thanks again for saving me earlier!&#10;I would have been in big trouble if it wasn't for you.</ScenarioTalk3_1>
    <ScenarioTalk3_2>My name is Popo! I help out at the store!</ScenarioTalk3_2>
    <ScenarioTalk3_3>- You tell her that you simply did your civic duty -</ScenarioTalk3_3>
    <ScenarioTalk3_4>No, that is not true!! Not many people have the courage to help in that kind of dangerous situation.</ScenarioTalk3_4>
    <ScenarioTalk3_5>I really thought I was going to die... Thanks again!</ScenarioTalk3_5>
    <ScenarioTalk3_6>- You asked Popo about the village -</ScenarioTalk3_6>
    <ScenarioTalk3_7>Oh! This is where you can trade essences for Dragon Eggs!</ScenarioTalk3_7>
    <ScenarioTalk3_8> The only problem is that the Dragon Eggs are chosen randomly.&#10;There is no way to predict the outcome!</ScenarioTalk3_8>
    
    <ScenarioTalk3_9>- You asked about the ways to collect essences -</ScenarioTalk3_9>
    
    <ScenarioTalk3_10>You can obtain essences during your adventures!</ScenarioTalk3_10>
    <ScenarioTalk3_11>If you bring me the required essences,&#10;I will trade them for Dragon Eggs for you! Go ahead and start collecting essences now!!</ScenarioTalk3_11>
    <ScenarioTalk3_12>Of course~ But don't go too crazy with it! Okay?!</ScenarioTalk3_12>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk4_1>- Amid the loud noises of villagers,&#10;You spotted a kid with sharp eyes. -</ScenarioTalk4_1>
    <ScenarioTalk4_2>What are you looking at?&#10;Spit it out if you have anything to say!!</ScenarioTalk4_2>
    <ScenarioTalk4_3>Huh? Oh! It's you, Nuri. Welcome back!!</ScenarioTalk4_3>
    <ScenarioTalk4_4>... But who is this kid?</ScenarioTalk4_4>
    <ScenarioTalk4_5>Hey, watch your language!!</ScenarioTalk4_5>
    <ScenarioTalk4_6>You have to understand. He has been through a lot,&#10;which made him very stubborn! His name is Romini!</ScenarioTalk4_6>
    <ScenarioTalk4_7>I am in charge of purchasing various items collected from adventures...</ScenarioTalk4_7>
    <ScenarioTalk4_8>You will probably be back to sell something to him!</ScenarioTalk4_8>
    <ScenarioTalk4_9>Whatever! But I will not overpay for used items you've collected from adventures!</ScenarioTalk4_9>
    <ScenarioTalk4_10>I need to make a profit in order to stay in business!&#10;I gotta go, I am busy!</ScenarioTalk4_10>
    <ScenarioTalk4_11>- Romini spoke bluntly and walked away -</ScenarioTalk4_11>
    <ScenarioTalk4_12>He has a good heart... Once you get to know him,&#10;you two will get along just fine...</ScenarioTalk4_12>
    <ScenarioTalk4_13>Anyway! If you want to sell something, ask Romini!</ScenarioTalk4_13>
    <ScenarioTalk4_14>Hmmm... Whatever... We've just started our journey!&#10;I won't let him get to me.</ScenarioTalk4_14>
    <ScenarioTalk4_15>Yeah! That's the spirit!</ScenarioTalk4_15>
    
    <ScenarioTalk5_1>I haven't seen you before...</ScenarioTalk5_1>
    <ScenarioTalk5_2>My name is Yulia... As you can tell,&#10;I provide visions and advice to people at the Spirit Lodge.</ScenarioTalk5_2>
    <ScenarioTalk5_3>- You simply smiled back at her...&#10;She hesitated for a second and slowly opened her mouth to speak -</ScenarioTalk5_3>
    <ScenarioTalk5_4>...I assume Nuri and Jimon have already told you...&#10;About the recent monster attacks...</ScenarioTalk5_4>
    <ScenarioTalk5_5>Monsters started to raid our village after the War of Light and Dark...&#10;between the Ancient Dragons and Dark Nix...</ScenarioTalk5_5>
    <ScenarioTalk5_6>Both the number of monsters and the frequency of the raids have increased exponentially...</ScenarioTalk5_6>
    <ScenarioTalk5_7>But it doesn't seem like it will destroy the village.</ScenarioTalk5_7>
    <ScenarioTalk5_8>- You asked Yulia to explain further -</ScenarioTalk5_8>
    <ScenarioTalk5_9>It almost looked like they were running away from something scary...</ScenarioTalk5_9>
    <ScenarioTalk5_10>Something very big...</ScenarioTalk5_10>
    <ScenarioTalk5_11>- Like what? -</ScenarioTalk5_11>
    <ScenarioTalk5_12>According to my visions, it is a dangerous creature.</ScenarioTalk5_12>
    <ScenarioTalk5_13>Something big and powerful is approaching us.</ScenarioTalk5_13>
    <ScenarioTalk5_14>But it is surrounded by the clouds right now... and cannot be seen, yet.</ScenarioTalk5_14>
    <ScenarioTalk5_15>- You nodded -</ScenarioTalk5_15>
    <ScenarioTalk5_16>It is just one of the many visions I've had...&#10;I can't tell for sure what is causing the monsters to panic and run away...</ScenarioTalk5_16>
    <ScenarioTalk5_17>Even for an expert like me...</ScenarioTalk5_17>
    
    <ScenarioTalk5_18>What! I've been looking for you. What were you doing here?</ScenarioTalk5_18>
    <ScenarioTalk5_19>What? Hey Romini! What's all the urgency about?</ScenarioTalk5_19>
    <ScenarioTalk5_20>Monsters have attacked the village just after you left!</ScenarioTalk5_20>
    <ScenarioTalk5_21>Oh, no! Was anyone hurt!</ScenarioTalk5_21>
    <ScenarioTalk5_22>Not seriously. But all the items I bought got ruined!</ScenarioTalk5_22>
    <ScenarioTalk5_23>Well... as long as no one got hurt.</ScenarioTalk5_23>
    <ScenarioTalk5_24>Wait ... I was expecting huge profit from those items. It's all your fault!</ScenarioTalk5_24>
    <ScenarioTalk5_25>- ? -</ScenarioTalk5_25>
    <ScenarioTalk5_26>Anyway... I want you to go and punish those monsters in the Shipwreck!</ScenarioTalk5_26>
    <ScenarioTalk5_27>You need to kill at least %1$s monsters for me to calm my angers. Well... gots to go. See ya~!</ScenarioTalk5_27>
    <ScenarioTalk5_28>- Romini left even before you got a chance to talk. -</ScenarioTalk5_28>
    <ScenarioTalk5_29>He's still reckless....</ScenarioTalk5_29>
    <ScenarioTalk5_30>Don't worry. We can get those monsters in no time if we do it together!</ScenarioTalk5_30>
    <ScenarioTalk5_31>Well... let's head over to the Shipwreck before it gets dark.</ScenarioTalk5_31>
    <ScenarioTalk5_32>Well? Like I said. We got done pretty quickly, right?</ScenarioTalk5_32>
    <ScenarioTalk5_33>Well... I don't trust you, yet... but I do acknowledge that you did well. Oh, there's no reward or anything like that!</ScenarioTalk5_33>
    <ScenarioTalk5_34>Righteous hero is suppose to help others, out of their goodness!</ScenarioTalk5_34>
    <ScenarioTalk5_35>Well... got to go. So long!</ScenarioTalk5_35>
    <ScenarioTalk5_36>Ah... in case you didn't catch it... it was his long way of saying Thanks!</ScenarioTalk5_36>
    <ScenarioTalk5_37>Well... shall we get going also?</ScenarioTalk5_37>
    <ScenarioTalk5_38>There still are many places we need to explore!</ScenarioTalk5_38>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk6_1>What else do the Dragon Tamers need in combat?</ScenarioTalk6_1>
    <ScenarioTalk6_2>Probably their training ability and luck.</ScenarioTalk6_2>
    <ScenarioTalk6_3>So I just have to be lucky then! Hahaha.</ScenarioTalk6_3>
    <ScenarioTalk6_4>Why are you forgetting about the Tamer's training ability?</ScenarioTalk6_4>
    <ScenarioTalk6_5>Nonsense!! The most important thing in a combat situation is!!!</ScenarioTalk6_5>
    <ScenarioTalk6_6>Combat items! The items are essential!!</ScenarioTalk6_6>
    <ScenarioTalk6_7>- A muscular man jumped into our conversation -</ScenarioTalk6_7>
    <ScenarioTalk6_8>Ah! I forgot to introduce myself! I am Kanggalo, the Captain of the Guard for the village!!</ScenarioTalk6_8>
    <ScenarioTalk6_9>I protect the villagers with my life and keep them safe!</ScenarioTalk6_9>
    <ScenarioTalk6_10>I am a lucky adventurer with a strong will and the desire to protect others!</ScenarioTalk6_10>
    <ScenarioTalk6_11>- ..................... -</ScenarioTalk6_11>
    <ScenarioTalk6_12>.....................</ScenarioTalk6_12>
    <ScenarioTalk6_13>.....................</ScenarioTalk6_13>
    <ScenarioTalk6_14>Okay... Hmm... Anyway! I am curious...Tell me more!</ScenarioTalk6_14>
    <ScenarioTalk6_15>Once combat items are equipped to a dragon,&#10;they will boost your Attack, Defense, HP, Critical Attack and Agility to help you win!</ScenarioTalk6_15>
    <ScenarioTalk6_16>They are crucial in adventures and battles!</ScenarioTalk6_16>
    <ScenarioTalk6_17>Okay! Wait a second!! I have a present for you guys!</ScenarioTalk6_17>
    <ScenarioTalk6_18>I am not only good looking but also generous!!!</ScenarioTalk6_18>
    <ScenarioTalk6_19>- He gave you an item covered in dust -</ScenarioTalk6_19>
    <ScenarioTalk6_20>What..? This is...</ScenarioTalk6_20>
    <ScenarioTalk6_21>Oh! This is a combat item! You can equip it to improve your dragon's abilities!</ScenarioTalk6_21>
    <ScenarioTalk6_22>If you really want to thank me...</ScenarioTalk6_22>
    <ScenarioTalk6_23>Tell other girls about my charming good looks and bravery!</ScenarioTalk6_23>
    <ScenarioTalk6_24>I shine like a star on the battlefield and have impressive killing records!</ScenarioTalk6_24>
    <ScenarioTalk6_25>I am looking for a woman to settle down with... Wait! I am not done yet!!</ScenarioTalk6_25>
    <ScenarioTalk6_26>- You thought that he is surprisingly sentimental given his rough exterior... -</ScenarioTalk6_26>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk7_1>Are combat items a necessity?</ScenarioTalk7_1>
    <ScenarioTalk7_2>I am forgetting something... Oh well.</ScenarioTalk7_2>
    <ScenarioTalk7_3>Nonsense! Going into battle with only one combat item?&#10;Are you serious?</ScenarioTalk7_3>
    <ScenarioTalk7_4>- ........ Who are you? -</ScenarioTalk7_4>
    <ScenarioTalk7_5>Ah... Sorry! I got too excited! My name is Randolph!!</ScenarioTalk7_5>
    <ScenarioTalk7_6>As you can see, I am an honest merchant selling only necessary Gems to prepare you for future battles!!</ScenarioTalk7_6>
    <ScenarioTalk7_7>I am also very good looking and...</ScenarioTalk7_7>
    <ScenarioTalk7_8>..............</ScenarioTalk7_8>
    <ScenarioTalk7_9>..............</ScenarioTalk7_9>
    <ScenarioTalk7_10>...That was just mean... If you had just agreed with me, I was going to give you a free Gem...</ScenarioTalk7_10>
    <ScenarioTalk7_11>You look stunning!!!</ScenarioTalk7_11>
    <ScenarioTalk7_12>You are the ideal guy for me!!</ScenarioTalk7_12>
    <ScenarioTalk7_13>..............</ScenarioTalk7_13>
    <ScenarioTalk7_14>Ha... Anyway, there are 3 types of Gems: Attack, Defense and HP!</ScenarioTalk7_14>
    <ScenarioTalk7_15>Please use them wisely, as Gems are difficult to detach once equipped!</ScenarioTalk7_15>
    <ScenarioTalk7_16>You look like a beginner... Since I am generous, I will give you one for free!</ScenarioTalk7_16>
    <ScenarioTalk7_17>- Randolph gave you a Gem covered in dust -</ScenarioTalk7_17>
    <ScenarioTalk7_18>It is not the best gem, but this should do for you!</ScenarioTalk7_18>
    <ScenarioTalk7_19>Are you giving this away because no one wants it? Haha</ScenarioTalk7_19>
    <ScenarioTalk7_20>Are you just trying to get rid of this?</ScenarioTalk7_20>
    <ScenarioTalk7_21>.....Hahahaha</ScenarioTalk7_21>
    <ScenarioTalk7_22>Take it! It will come in handy!</ScenarioTalk7_22>
    <ScenarioTalk7_23>Well... It is better than nothing...!</ScenarioTalk7_23>
    <ScenarioTalk7_24>Everyone in this town has quite a strong character...</ScenarioTalk7_24>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk8_1>Fire Mountain is home to various Fire dragons!&#10;They are everywhere!</ScenarioTalk8_1>
    <ScenarioTalk8_2>And there are many dangerous monsters as well!</ScenarioTalk8_2>
    <ScenarioTalk8_3>As long as you can handle the monsters, the mountain shouldn't be too dangerous...</ScenarioTalk8_3>
    <ScenarioTalk8_4>Hey, take a look at that unusually round white rock...</ScenarioTalk8_4>
    <ScenarioTalk8_5>Round...? Huh?! That's an Egg.</ScenarioTalk8_5>
    <ScenarioTalk8_6> You have keen eyes for spotting Eggs...&#10;But the Egg is floating on lava. How are you planning to pick it up?</ScenarioTalk8_6>
    <ScenarioTalk8_7>......</ScenarioTalk8_7>
    <ScenarioTalk8_8>......</ScenarioTalk8_8>
    <ScenarioTalk8_9>- For about 30 minutes, Nuri and Jimon tried hard to pick up the Egg from the lava... -</ScenarioTalk8_9>
    <ScenarioTalk8_10>- They finally rescued the Egg after many failures -</ScenarioTalk8_10>
    <ScenarioTalk8_11>Finally, we got the Egg!!! This has to be a Legendary Dragon Egg!!</ScenarioTalk8_11>
    <ScenarioTalk8_12>Hehehe! This is mine!!</ScenarioTalk8_12>
    <ScenarioTalk8_13>This is a Lava Dragon Egg...</ScenarioTalk8_13>
    <ScenarioTalk8_14>......What?</ScenarioTalk8_14>
    <ScenarioTalk8_15>Lava Dragon..</ScenarioTalk8_15>
    <ScenarioTalk8_16>......</ScenarioTalk8_16>
    <ScenarioTalk8_17>Don't look at me like that.</ScenarioTalk8_17>
    <ScenarioTalk8_18>Ah...Ah...Ahahahah...</ScenarioTalk8_18>
    <ScenarioTalk8_19>Stop crying...</ScenarioTalk8_19>
    <ScenarioTalk8_20>Ugh! This was not what I expected at all!!</ScenarioTalk8_20>
    <ScenarioTalk8_21>It is still a Dragon Egg.</ScenarioTalk8_21>
    <ScenarioTalk8_22>.......</ScenarioTalk8_22>
    <ScenarioTalk8_23>...Oh well!</ScenarioTalk8_23>
    
    <ScenarioTalk8_24>- Someone was searching for something in the distant. -</ScenarioTalk8_24>
    <ScenarioTalk8_25>Oh, hello. It's good to see you again.</ScenarioTalk8_25>
    <ScenarioTalk8_26>Yulia? What were you looking for?</ScenarioTalk8_26>
    <ScenarioTalk8_27>Don't you work in the Magic Shop now days?</ScenarioTalk8_27>
    <ScenarioTalk8_28>Ah... I was searching for magic stones I need for fortune telling.</ScenarioTalk8_28>
    <ScenarioTalk8_29>- Magic Stones? -</ScenarioTalk8_29>
    <ScenarioTalk8_30>Well... I need to go back to my shop but...</ScenarioTalk8_30>
    <ScenarioTalk8_31>The carriage that was delivering the Magic Stones was ambushed by the monsters... and...</ScenarioTalk8_31>
    <ScenarioTalk8_32>without those Magic Stones, I can't use my tools.</ScenarioTalk8_32>
    <ScenarioTalk8_33>I see. It's always those monsters that are causing troubles!</ScenarioTalk8_33>
    <ScenarioTalk8_34>- You tell Yulia that you will help her find the Magic Stones. -</ScenarioTalk8_34>
    <ScenarioTalk8_35>Oh, thank you! If you would do that for me, then I can go back to my shop.</ScenarioTalk8_35>
    <ScenarioTalk8_36>The delivery carriage was attacked when it was passing through deep in the Fire Mountain.</ScenarioTalk8_36>
    <ScenarioTalk8_37>Well then. I guess I can find the Magic Stones if I explore the Fire Mountain.</ScenarioTalk8_37>
    <ScenarioTalk8_38>Well... let's go! </ScenarioTalk8_38>
    <ScenarioTalk8_39>Wow! What are these strange looking stones?</ScenarioTalk8_39>
    <ScenarioTalk8_40>I'm certain that these are the Magic Stones. Let's bring it back to Yulia!</ScenarioTalk8_40>
    <ScenarioTalk8_41>- You nodded and put the Magic Stones in the bag. -</ScenarioTalk8_41>
    <ScenarioTalk8_42>....Yes. They are Magic Stones. Thank you very much!</ScenarioTalk8_42>
    <ScenarioTalk8_43>If you stop by again later, I will have a nice gift ready for you.</ScenarioTalk8_43>
    <ScenarioTalk8_44>- Yulia thanked you and rushed back to the village. -</ScenarioTalk8_44>
    <ScenarioTalk8_45>Doing good deeds always makes me feel good!</ScenarioTalk8_45>
    <ScenarioTalk8_46>What are you talking about? You didn't do a thing.</ScenarioTalk8_46>
    <ScenarioTalk8_47>Well... umm... let's continue with our exploration!</ScenarioTalk8_47>
    <ScenarioTalk8_48>Agreed!</ScenarioTalk8_48>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk9_1>A dragon becomes a Hatchling at level 10</ScenarioTalk9_1>
    <ScenarioTalk9_2>Hatchlings can learn skills,&#10;which can be taught using Scrolls or acquired naturally during adventures.</ScenarioTalk9_2>
    <ScenarioTalk9_3>Skills acquired using Scrolls have higher values than the ones learned naturally during adventures.</ScenarioTalk9_3>
    <ScenarioTalk9_4>But you can trade them with other Dragon Tamers.</ScenarioTalk9_4>
    <ScenarioTalk9_5>- You asked if there is anything special about them -</ScenarioTalk9_5>
    <ScenarioTalk9_6>Depending on the dragon skill slots, the specialized skills can vary.</ScenarioTalk9_6>
    <ScenarioTalk9_7>Since there are various skills to choose from,&#10;you can use them strategically according to the circumstances.</ScenarioTalk9_7>
    <ScenarioTalk9_8>Umm...... I would like to give you a small present for protecting the village.</ScenarioTalk9_8>
    <ScenarioTalk9_9>- Yulia picked up a small box from a corner -</ScenarioTalk9_9>
    <ScenarioTalk9_10>I hope this Skill Scroll helps.</ScenarioTalk9_10>
    <ScenarioTalk9_11>Of course, it will make me happy if you put it to good use......</ScenarioTalk9_11>
    <ScenarioTalk9_12>-I nodded and accepted the gift -</ScenarioTalk9_12>
    <ScenarioTalk9_13>... My visions warned me of a great danger coming your way.</ScenarioTalk9_13>
    <ScenarioTalk9_14>Take care of yourself.</ScenarioTalk9_14>
    <ScenarioTalk9_15>- You nodded again -</ScenarioTalk9_15>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk10_1>Oh~ Are you the one who saved our town from the monsters?</ScenarioTalk10_1>
    <ScenarioTalk10_2>You are not what I expected...?</ScenarioTalk10_2>
    <ScenarioTalk10_3>I was expecting a bulky guy.</ScenarioTalk10_3>
    <ScenarioTalk10_4>I am Baruss, the lord of this town!</ScenarioTalk10_4>
    <ScenarioTalk10_5>I also own a store and run it on the side!</ScenarioTalk10_5>
    <ScenarioTalk10_6>I believe fate has brought you here to our town. Let me tell you something!</ScenarioTalk10_6>
    <ScenarioTalk10_7>Fatigue builds up in increments of 1 for each adventure...&#10;But you can recover it by simply resting before going on another journey.</ScenarioTalk10_7>
    <ScenarioTalk10_8>- You nodded -</ScenarioTalk10_8>
    <ScenarioTalk10_9>Of course there are other ways... Like this!</ScenarioTalk10_9>
    <ScenarioTalk10_10>- Baruss pulled out a bottle with a mysterious liquid inside -</ScenarioTalk10_10>
    <ScenarioTalk10_11>Energy Drinks! They will instantly boost your energy and get rid of your fatigue!</ScenarioTalk10_11>
    <ScenarioTalk10_12>But they cost Gems... If you are not in a rush, just rest.</ScenarioTalk10_12>
    <ScenarioTalk10_13>Ah! Since you saved my town, I will give you one as a reward! Take it, it will come in handy later!!</ScenarioTalk10_13>
    <ScenarioTalk10_14>- You received an Energy Drink from Baruss -</ScenarioTalk10_14>
    <ScenarioTalk10_15>You can also get Energy Drinks through gambling...</ScenarioTalk10_15>
    <ScenarioTalk10_16>But...I lost more than I won...Sigh...</ScenarioTalk10_16>
    <ScenarioTalk10_17>Since I've already started talking about this... Hear me out!...So...</ScenarioTalk10_17>
    <ScenarioTalk10_18>- You listened to a long life lesson from Baruss for the entire rest of the day -</ScenarioTalk10_18>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk11_1>There are 9 elements available for dragons. 4 basics like Fire, Earth, Wind, Aqua.&#10;And also paternal Light, Dark and upper element Holy, Chaos, non-incomplatible to all elements Shadow.</ScenarioTalk11_1>
    <ScenarioTalk11_2>Each essence has a counter essence... It is important to pair dragons strategically for tag matches!</ScenarioTalk11_2>
    <ScenarioTalk11_3>Hmm... Are you talking about how Light is strong against the Dark?</ScenarioTalk11_3>
    <ScenarioTalk11_4>You got it. But... The 4 basic essences!</ScenarioTalk11_4>
    <ScenarioTalk11_5>They did not exist naturally.</ScenarioTalk11_5>
    <ScenarioTalk11_6>They appeared after the War of Light and Dark.</ScenarioTalk11_6>
    <ScenarioTalk11_7>You can think of Light and Dark as the origins of the basic 4 essences.</ScenarioTalk11_7>
    <ScenarioTalk11_8>I guess that makes sense!</ScenarioTalk11_8>
    
    <ScenarioTalk11_9>Hey.. did you hear that?</ScenarioTalk11_9>
    <ScenarioTalk11_10>Oweeee!</ScenarioTalk11_10>
    <ScenarioTalk11_11>Kang... Kanggalo? What happened?</ScenarioTalk11_11>
    <ScenarioTalk11_12>Owee... monsters... I was ambushed!</ScenarioTalk11_12>
    <ScenarioTalk11_13>If we let this continue, Elpis will be in danger!</ScenarioTalk11_13>
    <ScenarioTalk11_14>Where are the monsters?</ScenarioTalk11_14>
    <ScenarioTalk11_15>Wind... the Wind Temple. There were about %1$s of them!</ScenarioTalk11_15>
    <ScenarioTalk11_16>We've got no time to lose! Let's rush over to the Wind Temple!</ScenarioTalk11_16>
    <ScenarioTalk11_17>I never knew that there were these many monsters here.</ScenarioTalk11_17>
    <ScenarioTalk11_18>Someone evil is definitely conspiring something horrible.</ScenarioTalk11_18>
    <ScenarioTalk11_19>Let's explore this area first! We didn't find all of them, yet.</ScenarioTalk11_19>
    <ScenarioTalk11_20>Great! We got rid of all those horrible monsters. The village should be safe... for now.</ScenarioTalk11_20>
    <ScenarioTalk11_21>Kanggalo said thanks for getting rid of the monsters. He wants me to tell you thank you also!</ScenarioTalk11_21>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk12_1>Can you see the golden dragon statue on the floating island over there?</ScenarioTalk12_1>
    <ScenarioTalk12_2>- As you looked up at the sky, you spotted the statue -</ScenarioTalk12_2>
    <ScenarioTalk12_3>That is God's representative, the Ancient Divine Dragon (AKA the "Father of Light")</ScenarioTalk12_3>
    <ScenarioTalk12_4>He protected the land of Yutakan and fought against Dark Nix</ScenarioTalk12_4>
    <ScenarioTalk12_5>Of course, the aftermath of the battle led to instability in our world...</ScenarioTalk12_5>
    <ScenarioTalk12_6>There wasn't anything we could do...</ScenarioTalk12_6>
    <ScenarioTalk12_7>We would not be here if the Ancient Divine Dragon hadn't stopped Dark Nix at the time...</ScenarioTalk12_7>
    <ScenarioTalk12_8>There were three more dragons who fought against Dark Nix.</ScenarioTalk12_8>
    <ScenarioTalk12_9>The Lighting Dragon of Fire! The Glacier Dragon of Aqua!</ScenarioTalk12_9>
    <ScenarioTalk12_10>And the Power Dragon of Earth!</ScenarioTalk12_10>
    <ScenarioTalk12_11>Also... According to the old records...</ScenarioTalk12_11>
    <ScenarioTalk12_12>Other ancient dragons sided with the Light and the Dark to fight each other.</ScenarioTalk12_12>
    <ScenarioTalk12_13>- Ancient dragons... -</ScenarioTalk12_13>
    
    <ScenarioTalk12_14>By the way... isn't there more stories about the 4 Divine Dragons?</ScenarioTalk12_14>
    <ScenarioTalk12_15>Different story?</ScenarioTalk12_15>
    <ScenarioTalk12_16>I mean... if they are so famous... shouldn't there be many stories about them?</ScenarioTalk12_16>
    <ScenarioTalk12_17>Well... but what we know is just a small part of it.</ScenarioTalk12_17>
    <ScenarioTalk12_18>*Clearing throat sound...</ScenarioTalk12_18>
    <ScenarioTalk12_19>What the? You surprised me, Mr. Baruss!</ScenarioTalk12_19>
    <ScenarioTalk12_20>Ha, ha! Hi there children!</ScenarioTalk12_20>
    <ScenarioTalk12_21>Nuri... still looking brave as always.</ScenarioTalk12_21>
    <ScenarioTalk12_22>.......</ScenarioTalk12_22>
    <ScenarioTalk12_23>And that chubby looking egg... what the...!</ScenarioTalk12_23>
    <ScenarioTalk12_24>- Jimon jumped and attacked Mr. Baruss when he called Jimon an egg. -</ScenarioTalk12_24>
    <ScenarioTalk12_25>You bad egg monster you! How there you attack an old man?</ScenarioTalk12_25>
    <ScenarioTalk12_26>You rude senile old man. You want respect? Then earn it!</ScenarioTalk12_26>
    <ScenarioTalk12_27>- You calmed puffing Jimon down. -</ScenarioTalk12_27>
    <ScenarioTalk12_28>Anyway... I overheard that you wanted to know more about the 4 Divine Dragons.</ScenarioTalk12_28>
    <ScenarioTalk12_29>I'll tell you the untold story!</ScenarioTalk12_29>
    <ScenarioTalk12_30>Really?</ScenarioTalk12_30>
    <ScenarioTalk12_31>Well... of course... not for free! You need to do me a favor.</ScenarioTalk12_31>
    <ScenarioTalk12_32>I knew it! You greedy senile old...</ScenarioTalk12_32>
    <ScenarioTalk12_33>Anyway... I just need you to eliminate %1$s monsters in the Sky Temple.</ScenarioTalk12_33>
    <ScenarioTalk12_34>And for that, I will tell you a very special story about the 4 Divine Dragons.</ScenarioTalk12_34>
    <ScenarioTalk12_35>- Well... what do we have to lose? Let's go for it. -</ScenarioTalk12_35>
    <ScenarioTalk12_36>Oh, ho! You guys are pretty skilled dragon tamers!</ScenarioTalk12_36>
    <ScenarioTalk12_37>Well... it's your turn grandpa! Tell us about the untold story on the 4 Divine Dragons!</ScenarioTalk12_37>
    <ScenarioTalk12_38>What? Did I say that?</ScenarioTalk12_38>
    <ScenarioTalk12_39>.......</ScenarioTalk12_39>
    <ScenarioTalk12_40>This senile old fart!</ScenarioTalk12_40>
    <ScenarioTalk12_41>Phuhaha! I have a date with granny! See ya!</ScenarioTalk12_41>
    <ScenarioTalk12_42>But thanks for doing my work for me. You guys will be blessed. Hahaha.</ScenarioTalk12_42>
    <ScenarioTalk12_43>- Mr. Baruss disappeared in the distance. Well... let's consider it a voluntary work.-</ScenarioTalk12_43>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk13_1>Huh? Yeah...I heard you saved our town... Anyway...&#10;You are really working hard to train your dragon, aren't you?</ScenarioTalk13_1>
    <ScenarioTalk13_2>Let me, Pino, help you out!</ScenarioTalk13_2>
    <ScenarioTalk13_3>- ? -</ScenarioTalk13_3>
    <ScenarioTalk13_4>I will tell you a secret! When a dragon becomes an adult, you can enter into the Colosseum to fight against other Dragon Tamers!!</ScenarioTalk13_4>
    <ScenarioTalk13_5>Given the immense size of the land of Yutakan, there are many strong Tamers at the Colosseum!</ScenarioTalk13_5>
    <ScenarioTalk13_6>I am sure there will be other Dragon Tamers who are weaker than you!</ScenarioTalk13_6>
    <ScenarioTalk13_7>If you really want, I can tell you a secret to win the tournament!</ScenarioTalk13_7>
    <ScenarioTalk13_8>- You eagerly asked questions to learn about the secret -</ScenarioTalk13_8>
    <ScenarioTalk13_9>Haha, are you interested? I'll tell you......&#10;The secret is that there aren't any! Haha</ScenarioTalk13_9>
    <ScenarioTalk13_10>- Pino burst out laughing and gave me a nudge -</ScenarioTalk13_10>
    <ScenarioTalk13_11>Winning a battle is based on the Dragon Tamer's abilities and luck! Those two things!!</ScenarioTalk13_11>
    <ScenarioTalk13_12>Instead of looking for a shortcut, focus on training your dragon!!</ScenarioTalk13_12>
    <ScenarioTalk13_13>- ........ -</ScenarioTalk13_13>
    <ScenarioTalk13_14>It takes time and effort! There are no secrets...</ScenarioTalk13_14>
    <ScenarioTalk13_15>But you are doing pretty well! </ScenarioTalk13_15>
    <ScenarioTalk13_16>Keep doing what you are doing! And try to get my attention. Hahaha</ScenarioTalk13_16>
    
    <ScenarioTalk14_1>Um~ You are starting to become a real Dragon Tamer!</ScenarioTalk14_1>
    <ScenarioTalk14_2>You are getting better at it really fast~ I am proud of you. My baby is growing up. Hahaha</ScenarioTalk14_2>
    <ScenarioTalk14_3>Your dragon is also getting closer to level 25, when it becomes an adult!!</ScenarioTalk14_3>
    <ScenarioTalk14_4>Once your dragon becomes an adult, you will be able to make decisions on various things!!</ScenarioTalk14_4>
    <ScenarioTalk14_5>Are you talking about exploring different regions and leveling up your dragons to beat the record?</ScenarioTalk14_5>
    <ScenarioTalk14_6>But if you level up your dragons, it is difficult to explore other regions unless you have another dragon!</ScenarioTalk14_6>
    <ScenarioTalk14_7>If it was up to me, I would explore new regions!</ScenarioTalk14_7>
    <ScenarioTalk14_8>More adventures will be waiting for you!!</ScenarioTalk14_8>
    <ScenarioTalk14_9>Oh... I forgot to tell you! Adult dragons have the ability to develop their second skill at level 25!</ScenarioTalk14_9>
    <ScenarioTalk14_10>Take this Skill Scroll! It will help you in your future adventures!</ScenarioTalk14_10>
    <ScenarioTalk14_11>I gotta go. See you later!</ScenarioTalk14_11>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk15_1>- You spotted a shadow moving from a distance -</ScenarioTalk15_1>
    <ScenarioTalk15_2>What is that? A pig?! Is it a pig wearing human clothes!</ScenarioTalk15_2>
    <ScenarioTalk15_3>No, that is a person who looks like a pig!</ScenarioTalk15_3>
    <ScenarioTalk15_4>No way...!!</ScenarioTalk15_4>
    <ScenarioTalk15_5>I am telling you, you are wrong...!</ScenarioTalk15_5>
    <ScenarioTalk15_6>- You approached the shadow and asked him to identify himself -</ScenarioTalk15_6>
    <ScenarioTalk15_7>I am a Wandering Merchant... I am looking for my lost bead!</ScenarioTalk15_7>
    <ScenarioTalk15_8>Aha... You are a person...!</ScenarioTalk15_8>
    <ScenarioTalk15_9>Of course!!!</ScenarioTalk15_9>
    <ScenarioTalk15_10>I mean... you look handsome...</ScenarioTalk15_10>
    <ScenarioTalk15_11>By the way, what kind of bead are you looking for?</ScenarioTalk15_11>
    <ScenarioTalk15_12>Was that your Egg talking?</ScenarioTalk15_12>
    <ScenarioTalk15_13>I am a dragon!</ScenarioTalk15_13>
    <ScenarioTalk15_14>Oh~ I am so scared. Haha! It is a small blue bead...</ScenarioTalk15_14>
    <ScenarioTalk15_15>It is very expensive... I am in so much trouble!!</ScenarioTalk15_15>
    <ScenarioTalk15_16>- You picked up a blue bead from the ground and handed it to the merchant -</ScenarioTalk15_16>
    <ScenarioTalk15_17>Huh?! That's it! Thanks bro!! You've saved my life!!</ScenarioTalk15_17>
    <ScenarioTalk15_18>That must be very important to you!</ScenarioTalk15_18>
    <ScenarioTalk15_19>How much is it worth...?</ScenarioTalk15_19>
    <ScenarioTalk15_20>Thanks so much! How can I repay you for this?</ScenarioTalk15_20>
    <ScenarioTalk15_21>.....Sadly, I am broke right now... I will give you my sincere thanks and a hug!!!</ScenarioTalk15_21>
    <ScenarioTalk15_22>.....</ScenarioTalk15_22>
    <ScenarioTalk15_23>.....</ScenarioTalk15_23>
    <ScenarioTalk15_24>- ..... -</ScenarioTalk15_24>
    <ScenarioTalk15_25>Ha... Bro!!If you need my help in the future, please feel free to reach out!</ScenarioTalk15_25>
    <ScenarioTalk15_26>- The Wandering Merchant disappeared with a big smile on his face... -</ScenarioTalk15_26>
    <ScenarioTalk15_27>That was a weird looking pig... I mean person... I wonder where he is from!</ScenarioTalk15_27>
    <ScenarioTalk15_28>Oh well, we did a good deed!! Let's continue on our journey!!</ScenarioTalk15_28>
    
    <ScenarioTalk15_29>Oh ho! We meet again my nice dragon tamers!</ScenarioTalk15_29>
    <ScenarioTalk15_30>Hey... it's that pig...</ScenarioTalk15_30>
    <ScenarioTalk15_31>I'm not a pig! I'm a human!</ScenarioTalk15_31>
    <ScenarioTalk15_32>Well... anyway... what are you doing here?</ScenarioTalk15_32>
    <ScenarioTalk15_33>Oh... I came to see the Dragon Duel. It's the hottest thing in Yutakan!</ScenarioTalk15_33>
    <ScenarioTalk15_34>It seems like you are almost ready for entering the Colosseum.</ScenarioTalk15_34>
    <ScenarioTalk15_35>Well... I guess we'll be in the Colosseum pretty soon.</ScenarioTalk15_35>
    <ScenarioTalk15_36>Actually... I always wanted to see a real Dragon Duel.</ScenarioTalk15_36>
    <ScenarioTalk15_37>If not now... I really want to see it someday.</ScenarioTalk15_37>
    <ScenarioTalk15_38>Well... if you tag along... I'm sure you will see it!</ScenarioTalk15_38>
    <ScenarioTalk15_39>Anyone can compete in the Dragon Duel in the Colosseum as long as their dragon level is over Lv. 25.</ScenarioTalk15_39>
    <ScenarioTalk15_40>I see! Then let me tag along! Please show me Dragon Duel in the Colosseum ... about %1$s matches.</ScenarioTalk15_40>
    <ScenarioTalk15_41>- You nodded in agreement. -</ScenarioTalk15_41>
    <ScenarioTalk15_42>Excellent! It was a great show. Totally exciting!</ScenarioTalk15_42>
    <ScenarioTalk15_43>Well... got to go now. Sorry for taking your time. I'll be sure to have a nice gift ready next time.</ScenarioTalk15_43>
    <ScenarioTalk15_44>- Wandering Merchant disappeared in the distant. He may look that way but he is probably a nice guy... probably? -</ScenarioTalk15_44>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk16_1>Oh... Are you sure that something is heading toward us from the ocean?</ScenarioTalk16_1>
    <ScenarioTalk16_2>Yes! That's what I've heard!</ScenarioTalk16_2>
    <ScenarioTalk16_3>What's coming?!</ScenarioTalk16_3>
    <ScenarioTalk16_4>A strong creature is heading our way!</ScenarioTalk16_4>
    <ScenarioTalk16_5>Should we use the creature to our advantage?</ScenarioTalk16_5>
    <ScenarioTalk16_6>Great idea! You are so smart!! </ScenarioTalk16_6>
    <ScenarioTalk16_7>Will there be anyone who would interfere with us?!</ScenarioTalk16_7>
    <ScenarioTalk16_8>Yes! The Dragon Tamers!!</ScenarioTalk16_8>
    <ScenarioTalk16_9>I still remember what they did to us last time! The Dragon Tamers have historically interfered with our plans!!!</ScenarioTalk16_9>
    <ScenarioTalk16_10>There is a rumor that a strong Dragon Tamer has appeared in the land of Yutakan!!</ScenarioTalk16_10>
    <ScenarioTalk16_11>Why don't we strike them first this time?!!</ScenarioTalk16_11>
    <ScenarioTalk16_12>How?!</ScenarioTalk16_12>
    <ScenarioTalk16_13>I have an idea! Let me take handle these fools!!! I can use their empathy against them. Hehehe!!!!</ScenarioTalk16_13>
    <ScenarioTalk16_14>Great idea!! I will teach them a lesson once and for all!</ScenarioTalk16_14>
    <ScenarioTalk16_15>Hehehehe!</ScenarioTalk16_15>
    <ScenarioTalk16_16>Hahahaha!!</ScenarioTalk16_16>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk17_1>Since ancient times, the Dungeon has been known as a dangerous place...</ScenarioTalk17_1>
    <ScenarioTalk17_2>The place is filled with many dangerous, scary monsters...</ScenarioTalk17_2>
    <ScenarioTalk17_3> G-Skull and his crew have created various evil plots...</ScenarioTalk17_3>
    <ScenarioTalk17_4>The war between the Ancient Divine Dragon and Dark Nix was partly his creation as well...</ScenarioTalk17_4>
    <ScenarioTalk17_5>According to Kanggalo, our town's Captain of the Guard, G-Skull's underlings have been gathering quite often lately.</ScenarioTalk17_5>
    <ScenarioTalk17_6>- You asked Yulia for quest details -</ScenarioTalk17_6>
    <ScenarioTalk17_7>Please stop G-Skull from plotting another disaster!!</ScenarioTalk17_7>
    <ScenarioTalk17_8>His evil plans are probably beyond our imagination...</ScenarioTalk17_8>
    <ScenarioTalk17_9>- Have you heard anything...? -</ScenarioTalk17_9>
    <ScenarioTalk17_10>Nothing yet...</ScenarioTalk17_10>
    <ScenarioTalk17_11>Aha! Popo told me earlier that he saw some movements near the Dungeon...</ScenarioTalk17_11>
    <ScenarioTalk17_12>...Something terrible has happened!!</ScenarioTalk17_12>
    <ScenarioTalk17_13>Monkey's taken Popo!!!</ScenarioTalk17_13>
    <ScenarioTalk17_14>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk17_14>
    <ScenarioTalk17_15>- Where?! -</ScenarioTalk17_15>
    <ScenarioTalk17_16>The Skeleton Fortress!!</ScenarioTalk17_16>
    <ScenarioTalk17_17>Popo is in danger! We need to stop him!!</ScenarioTalk17_17>
    <ScenarioTalk17_18>- You are running out of time! Popo is in big trouble!! -</ScenarioTalk17_18>
    
    <ScenarioTalk18_1>What do you think you are doing? ...Taking me to this remote region?</ScenarioTalk18_1>
    <ScenarioTalk18_2>I have my reasons. Hehehe!!!</ScenarioTalk18_2>
    <ScenarioTalk18_3>We need a hostage to beat him!!!!</ScenarioTalk18_3>
    <ScenarioTalk18_4>...What are you trying to do with me?!?</ScenarioTalk18_4>
    <ScenarioTalk18_5>You are not as smart as you seem. Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk18_5>
    <ScenarioTalk18_6>G-Skull?!</ScenarioTalk18_6>
    <ScenarioTalk18_7>Yes! I guess you do have a brain after all. Haha. Can you wrap your small brain around this situation?</ScenarioTalk18_7>
    <ScenarioTalk18_8>I don't want the Dragon Tamer to get in our way!!</ScenarioTalk18_8>
    <ScenarioTalk18_9>Haha! It will make things easier if we can get rid of him now! </ScenarioTalk18_9>
    <ScenarioTalk18_10>You... dirty bastard...!!!</ScenarioTalk18_10>
    <ScenarioTalk18_11>Don't look at us like that! It's called being smart and strategic!!</ScenarioTalk18_11>
    <ScenarioTalk18_12>Hehehe! Once we beat the Dragon Tamers... The items coming in from the sea will be ours! Hahaha</ScenarioTalk18_12>
    <ScenarioTalk18_13>Items?</ScenarioTalk18_13>
    <ScenarioTalk18_14>Bonehead!!!!</ScenarioTalk18_14>
    <ScenarioTalk18_15>Sorry, please forgive me!!</ScenarioTalk18_15>
    <ScenarioTalk18_16>It doesn't matter...! I will kill him once he serves his purpose as bait! Hahahahahaha!!</ScenarioTalk18_16>
    <ScenarioTalk18_17>......!!!!</ScenarioTalk18_17>
    <ScenarioTalk18_18>G-Skull!! The Dragon Tamer is coming!!!</ScenarioTalk18_18>
    <ScenarioTalk18_19>Great! Let's give him a warm welcome. Hahahaha!!</ScenarioTalk18_19>
    <ScenarioTalk18_20>....No!</ScenarioTalk18_20>
    
    <ScenarioTalk19_1>- You entered the Skeleton Fortress and searched for Popo -</ScenarioTalk19_1>
    <ScenarioTalk19_2>Why are you in such a hurry?!! Hehehe</ScenarioTalk19_2>
    <ScenarioTalk19_3>This must be the Dragon Tamer that G-Skull mentioned earlier! Your journey stops here! Hehehe!!!!</ScenarioTalk19_3>
    <ScenarioTalk19_4>Aaaahhhhhh! My head!!</ScenarioTalk19_4>
    <ScenarioTalk19_5>- You captured Monkey and asked for Popo's whereabouts by scaring him with your dragon -</ScenarioTalk19_5>
    <ScenarioTalk19_6>There! Over there!! There's a passage at the end of the hall!!! I am telling you the truth!! So please get rid of your dragon!!!</ScenarioTalk19_6>
    <ScenarioTalk19_7>- You need to find Popo. There's no time to waste!! -</ScenarioTalk19_7>
    <ScenarioTalk19_8>Oh?! Monkey was all talk but no substance. I knew it!!</ScenarioTalk19_8>
    <ScenarioTalk19_9>I won't let you through here! Let's play!!</ScenarioTalk19_9>
    <ScenarioTalk19_10>Ahhh!! No way! He is too strong!</ScenarioTalk19_10>
    <ScenarioTalk19_11>- Tell me where Popo is!! -</ScenarioTalk19_11>
    <ScenarioTalk19_12>Hehe... Why should I tell you?</ScenarioTalk19_12>
    <ScenarioTalk19_13>You are the famous Dragon Tamer! We finally meet!</ScenarioTalk19_13>
    <ScenarioTalk19_14>Don't come any closer! It's a trap!!</ScenarioTalk19_14>
    <ScenarioTalk19_15>- You stared at G-Skull -</ScenarioTalk19_15>
    <ScenarioTalk19_16>Oh~~~ I am so scared... Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk19_16>
    <ScenarioTalk19_17>If you don't want him to get hurt, surrender now!!</ScenarioTalk19_17>
    <ScenarioTalk19_18>- When you thought that this was the end, someone rushed out from behind G-Skull -</ScenarioTalk19_18>
    <ScenarioTalk19_19>Huh? No way!!! You... bastards!!!!</ScenarioTalk19_19>
    <ScenarioTalk19_20>- Nuri and Jimon quickly rescued Popo from G-Skull - </ScenarioTalk19_20>
    <ScenarioTalk19_21>Now!!</ScenarioTalk19_21>
    <ScenarioTalk19_22>Punish him!</ScenarioTalk19_22>
    <ScenarioTalk19_23>We will meet again! I won't forget this humiliation!!!</ScenarioTalk19_23>
    <ScenarioTalk19_24>Don't forget about me!</ScenarioTalk19_24>
    <ScenarioTalk19_25>Krrrr!!</ScenarioTalk19_25>
    <ScenarioTalk19_26>- G-Skull and the monsters ran away -</ScenarioTalk19_26>
    <ScenarioTalk19_27>Popo is safe... Great job</ScenarioTalk19_27>
    <ScenarioTalk19_28>But why did they kidnap Popo?</ScenarioTalk19_28>
    <ScenarioTalk19_29>They were using me as a hostage to punish you...</ScenarioTalk19_29>
    <ScenarioTalk19_30>That's it? Are you sure?</ScenarioTalk19_30>
    <ScenarioTalk19_31>Also, something about you getting in the way of their plotting...</ScenarioTalk19_31>
    <ScenarioTalk19_32>Plotting?</ScenarioTalk19_32>
    <ScenarioTalk19_33>- You asked Popo to elaborate about their plotting -</ScenarioTalk19_33>
    <ScenarioTalk19_34>Something is coming from the sea.</ScenarioTalk19_34>
    <ScenarioTalk19_35>From the sea?</ScenarioTalk19_35>
    <ScenarioTalk19_36>Something? What exactly?</ScenarioTalk19_36>
    <ScenarioTalk19_37>Something strong... Very dangerous...</ScenarioTalk19_37>
    <ScenarioTalk19_38>- Popo fainted without finishing her sentence -</ScenarioTalk19_38>
    <ScenarioTalk19_39>...She must be tired</ScenarioTalk19_39>
    <ScenarioTalk19_40>Anyway... What do you think that means? Something strong from the sea...?</ScenarioTalk19_40>
    <ScenarioTalk19_41>Popo needs to rest first! Maybe Yulia will know something!!</ScenarioTalk19_41>
    <ScenarioTalk19_42>Okay! Let's head back to town...!!</ScenarioTalk19_42>
    <ScenarioTalk19_43>- You simply nodded -</ScenarioTalk19_43>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk20_1>Ugh! Look at me... in the same situation as this hideous creature!!</ScenarioTalk20_1>
    <ScenarioTalk20_2>What? You should be thankful that you are alive.</ScenarioTalk20_2>
    <ScenarioTalk20_3>Maybe that works for you!! It is an insult that I've lost to the Dragon Tamers... just like your ugly species!!</ScenarioTalk20_3>
    <ScenarioTalk20_4>God must be testing us!!</ScenarioTalk20_4>
    <ScenarioTalk20_5>How can you say that?! My sisters were right all along!!!</ScenarioTalk20_5>
    <ScenarioTalk20_6>Your kind of people are just pure evil!!</ScenarioTalk20_6>
    <ScenarioTalk20_7>Whatever! I am going to find someone who can assist me. Anyone will be better than you.</ScenarioTalk20_7>
    <ScenarioTalk20_8>Don't worry! I won't be following you anymore!!!</ScenarioTalk20_8>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk21_1>Wow, that was close! That was just low... even for evil G-Skull!!</ScenarioTalk21_1>
    <ScenarioTalk21_2>...More importantly...</ScenarioTalk21_2>
    <ScenarioTalk21_3>What?</ScenarioTalk21_3>
    <ScenarioTalk21_4>What G-Skull said worries me... Something dangerous will be coming from across the ocean.....</ScenarioTalk21_4>
    <ScenarioTalk21_5>Scary? What are you talking about?!</ScenarioTalk21_5>
    <ScenarioTalk21_6>G-Skull mentioned to Popo that something strong will be coming in from the ocean...</ScenarioTalk21_6>
    <ScenarioTalk21_7>They were trying to get rid of people who will be in their way...</ScenarioTalk21_7>
    <ScenarioTalk21_8>Something from across the ocean......?</ScenarioTalk21_8>
    <ScenarioTalk21_9>Ah...! But I have a hunch!</ScenarioTalk21_9>
    <ScenarioTalk21_10>...Randolph? Tell us more!</ScenarioTalk21_10>
    <ScenarioTalk21_11>I spotted a suspicious creature wandering around the Underwater Cave!</ScenarioTalk21_11>
    <ScenarioTalk21_12>I have never seen something like that before in my life!!</ScenarioTalk21_12>
    <ScenarioTalk21_13>Can you get a pen and paper??</ScenarioTalk21_13>
    <ScenarioTalk21_14>Huh... What is this supposed to be?</ScenarioTalk21_14>
    <ScenarioTalk21_15>One was tall and had pointy ears... and the other, bearded one, was short!!</ScenarioTalk21_15>
    <ScenarioTalk21_16>Take a closer look at it!</ScenarioTalk21_16>
    <ScenarioTalk21_17>This picture is a masterpiece. Do you really need me to explain any further?! Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk21_17>
    <ScenarioTalk21_18>This picture is too abstract for me. A new monster?</ScenarioTalk21_18>
    <ScenarioTalk21_19>Let's just ignore Randolph's story and look around!</ScenarioTalk21_19>
    <ScenarioTalk21_20>........</ScenarioTalk21_20>
    <ScenarioTalk21_21>I want to follow you guys... but I have to stick around and protect the town.</ScenarioTalk21_21>
    <ScenarioTalk21_22>We need to repair the damages from G-Skull's raid!!</ScenarioTalk21_22>
    <ScenarioTalk21_23>I will fix up the village first and catch up with you guys!!</ScenarioTalk21_23>
    <ScenarioTalk21_24>It is dangerous... Be careful. I will catch up with you guys!!</ScenarioTalk21_24>
    <ScenarioTalk21_25>- You headed to the Underwater Cave -</ScenarioTalk21_25>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk22_1>- You noticed distinct footprints all over the Underwater Cave -</ScenarioTalk22_1>
    <ScenarioTalk22_2>- The footprints were fresh... They couldn't be more than a couple of hours old -</ScenarioTalk22_2>
    <ScenarioTalk22_3>- ...?! -</ScenarioTalk22_3>
    <ScenarioTalk22_4>- You saw some movement in the corner!! -</ScenarioTalk22_4>
    <ScenarioTalk22_5>- Let's follow it! -</ScenarioTalk22_5>
    <ScenarioTalk22_6>- The shadow stopped abruptly!! -</ScenarioTalk22_6>
    <ScenarioTalk22_7>- Kkkk....hahahaha?! -</ScenarioTalk22_7>
    <ScenarioTalk22_8>- Death Worm was injured and has disappeared into the darkness... Am I hallucinating? -</ScenarioTalk22_8>
    <ScenarioTalk22_9>- You definitely saw something... but let's come back later! -</ScenarioTalk22_9>
    <ScenarioTalk22_10> ...... </ScenarioTalk22_10>
    
    <ScenarioTalk22_11>- Suspicious shadow was sighted in the Underwater Cave. -</ScenarioTalk22_11>
    <ScenarioTalk22_12>- How about thoroughly scouting the Underwater Cave one more time? -</ScenarioTalk22_12>
    <ScenarioTalk22_13>- Maybe you can find a clue before joining up with Nuri and Jimon. -</ScenarioTalk22_13>
    <ScenarioTalk22_14>- You thoroughly searched the Underwater Cave but you didn't see the suspicious shadow. -</ScenarioTalk22_14>
    <ScenarioTalk22_15>- Well... let's meet up with Nuri and Jimon and exchange information. -</ScenarioTalk22_15>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk23_1>- You met up with Nuri and Jimon to share your discovery at the cave -</ScenarioTalk23_1>
    <ScenarioTalk23_2>I investigated a couple of regions based on the story... I didn't see anything unusual... But...!</ScenarioTalk23_2>
    <ScenarioTalk23_3>There was something strange in the Underwater Cave...!</ScenarioTalk23_3>
    <ScenarioTalk23_4>- You agreed and talked about the strange shadow spotted inside the cave -</ScenarioTalk23_4>
    <ScenarioTalk23_5>Huh? Really? ...! Yes, you are right! I spotted a shadow as well...</ScenarioTalk23_5>
    <ScenarioTalk23_6>My god... I saw two shadows too... There were at least two people there!!</ScenarioTalk23_6>
    <ScenarioTalk23_7>...It seemed like they were transporting materials to build something!</ScenarioTalk23_7>
    <ScenarioTalk23_8>Yes...! Like a boat...!!</ScenarioTalk23_8>
    <ScenarioTalk23_9>Every time I followed them, they disappeared into the darkness!</ScenarioTalk23_9>
    <ScenarioTalk23_10>There must be a secret passage!!</ScenarioTalk23_10>
    <ScenarioTalk23_11>The town repairs are almost finished. Keep up the good work!</ScenarioTalk23_11>
    <ScenarioTalk23_12>We will keep gathering information... Don't worry! We will find something soon!</ScenarioTalk23_12>
    <ScenarioTalk23_13>You better hurry up... I have a bad feeling about this...!</ScenarioTalk23_13>
    <ScenarioTalk23_14> My prince charming, good luck!!</ScenarioTalk23_14>
    <ScenarioTalk23_15>- Playful Nuri walked away with a smile on her face -</ScenarioTalk23_15>
    <ScenarioTalk23_16>- Based on the information, one common thread is that there are people in the Underwater Cave...! -</ScenarioTalk23_16>
    <ScenarioTalk23_17>- Let's check out the cave one more time! -</ScenarioTalk23_17>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk24_1>- You are back again searching for a clue in the Underwater Cave. Everything seems normal... -</ScenarioTalk24_1>
    <ScenarioTalk24_2>- Let's go back and see if we missed anything -</ScenarioTalk24_2>
    <ScenarioTalk24_3>- ! -</ScenarioTalk24_3>
    <ScenarioTalk24_4>- You spotted a secret passage in the cave -</ScenarioTalk24_4>
    <ScenarioTalk24_5>- Based on the debris around the hole, the passage was relatively new... -</ScenarioTalk24_5>
    <ScenarioTalk24_6>- Let's check it out!! -</ScenarioTalk24_6>
    <ScenarioTalk24_7>This is all your fault!</ScenarioTalk24_7>
    <ScenarioTalk24_8>You brought them here. They followed your awful smell!!!</ScenarioTalk24_8>
    <ScenarioTalk24_9>Nonsense! It's your fault!! With your hideous ears!!</ScenarioTalk24_9>
    <ScenarioTalk24_10>Cursed midget!!</ScenarioTalk24_10>
    <ScenarioTalk24_11>Monstrous fairy!!!</ScenarioTalk24_11>
    <ScenarioTalk24_12>- They are surrounded by monsters! They will be in big trouble if you don't do anything!! -</ScenarioTalk24_12>
    <ScenarioTalk24_13>Hey! Please help us!!</ScenarioTalk24_13>
    <ScenarioTalk24_14>Hey you! Help!!!!</ScenarioTalk24_14>
    <ScenarioTalk24_15>- There was no time to waste. You stormed towards the monsters without hesitation! -</ScenarioTalk24_15>
    
    <ScenarioTalk24_15_1>Kaaaahhkk!~</ScenarioTalk24_15_1>
    
    <ScenarioTalk24_16>- The monsters ran away -</ScenarioTalk24_16>
    <ScenarioTalk24_17>- You can see the strangers clearly as the light came on. -</ScenarioTalk24_17>
    <ScenarioTalk24_18>- A stocky man and a tall, beautiful lady with pointy ears -</ScenarioTalk24_18>
    <ScenarioTalk24_19>-'... Monster?' -</ScenarioTalk24_19>
    <ScenarioTalk24_20>- The man slowly opened his mouth with a frown on his face -</ScenarioTalk24_20>
    <ScenarioTalk24_21>I can't curse at the person who saved my life... But that was rude! Calling us monsters...!</ScenarioTalk24_21>
    <ScenarioTalk24_22>I will agree only if you are referring to her!</ScenarioTalk24_22>
    <ScenarioTalk24_23>I am Arnold!</ScenarioTalk24_23>
    <ScenarioTalk24_24>I am a proud dwarf and the best blacksmith in the Metal Tower, the country of metals!</ScenarioTalk24_24>
    <ScenarioTalk24_25>The Metal Tower is the land of machines and dwarves! We can build any machine!!</ScenarioTalk24_25>
    <ScenarioTalk24_26>Unlike this stiff lady, I do not waste my life complaining about nature!</ScenarioTalk24_26>
    <ScenarioTalk24_27>I use nature to my advantage!!</ScenarioTalk24_27>
    <ScenarioTalk24_28>- The lady shoved Arnold and started to speak... -</ScenarioTalk24_28>
    <ScenarioTalk24_29>Hi... Thanks for saving us! My name is Florence!</ScenarioTalk24_29>
    <ScenarioTalk24_30>I am an elf, guardian of nature and warrior of Elysium!</ScenarioTalk24_30>
    <ScenarioTalk24_31>Elysium is the beautiful land of the elves... Where we coexist with nature!</ScenarioTalk24_31>
    <ScenarioTalk24_32>Unlike this savage, I don't destroy nature!</ScenarioTalk24_32>
    <ScenarioTalk24_33>- As soon as the introduction ended, they stared at each other as if they were about to fight -</ScenarioTalk24_33>
    <ScenarioTalk24_34>- You calmed them down and quickly changed the subject. -</ScenarioTalk24_34>
    <ScenarioTalk24_35>- You say that you heard that the Barrier of the legendary land of Yutakan has been weakened due to a recent event...</ScenarioTalk24_35>
    <ScenarioTalk24_36>We saw a big explosion from the Metal Tower as well...</ScenarioTalk24_36>
    <ScenarioTalk24_37>After the explosion, Yutakan was open to outsiders who were coming in on a boat...</ScenarioTalk24_37>
    <ScenarioTalk24_38>Our engineers assumed that there was a Barrier protecting the land of Yutakan....</ScenarioTalk24_38>
    <ScenarioTalk24_39>- A Barrier? A Barrier in Yutakan! -</ScenarioTalk24_39>
    <ScenarioTalk24_40>Huh? You didn't know...? Let me finish the story!!!</ScenarioTalk24_40>
    <ScenarioTalk24_41>When we were able to visit Yutakan after the explosion...</ScenarioTalk24_41>
    <ScenarioTalk24_42>Our mighty Dwarf King, who has had a strong interest in Yutakan for a while, hand-picked an elite team of dwarves to check out the area!!</ScenarioTalk24_42>
    <ScenarioTalk24_43>I was chosen to sail to Yutakan on a bright, sunny day~!</ScenarioTalk24_43>
    <ScenarioTalk24_44>That's when the problem started...! A dense cloud appeared out of nowhere!!</ScenarioTalk24_44>
    <ScenarioTalk24_45>And some scary ghost pirates attacked us!!!</ScenarioTalk24_45>
    <ScenarioTalk24_46>We tried our best, but our weapons were of no use against them!</ScenarioTalk24_46>
    <ScenarioTalk24_47>I barely got away... but they took my precious machine!</ScenarioTalk24_47>
    <ScenarioTalk24_48>When we are born... Our King grants us a machine! They are very important to us!</ScenarioTalk24_48>
    <ScenarioTalk24_49>We can never lose them. Never!!</ScenarioTalk24_49>
    <ScenarioTalk24_50>- Florence shoved Arnold to the side and told us her story -</ScenarioTalk24_50>
    <ScenarioTalk24_51>Just like this stupid dwarf! I have been ordered by my Queen to investigate Yutakan!!</ScenarioTalk24_51>
    <ScenarioTalk24_52>But we also ran into the ghost pirates and lost everything!</ScenarioTalk24_52>
    <ScenarioTalk24_53>I barely got away with the help of my guardian spirit...</ScenarioTalk24_53>
    <ScenarioTalk24_54>By the way... the pirates were heading in this direction!</ScenarioTalk24_54>
    <ScenarioTalk24_55>- This reminded you of G-Skull's story -</ScenarioTalk24_55>
    <ScenarioTalk24_56>- Something strong is coming from across the ocean... How are these two related?! -</ScenarioTalk24_56>
    <ScenarioTalk24_57>- Arnold crossed his arms and spoke with a frown on his face  -</ScenarioTalk24_57>
    <ScenarioTalk24_58>It was very strange... The pirates were immune to our attacks...</ScenarioTalk24_58>
    <ScenarioTalk24_59>But our machines seemed to work against the pirates</ScenarioTalk24_59>
    <ScenarioTalk24_60>The only reason we got away was because the machines sacrificed themselves to save us.</ScenarioTalk24_60>
    <ScenarioTalk24_61>I don't know if any other dwarves are still alive.</ScenarioTalk24_61>
    <ScenarioTalk24_62>A gem called "Stone Heart" is embedded into all of our machines.</ScenarioTalk24_62>
    <ScenarioTalk24_63>The "Stone Heart" is a rare mineral with mysterious powers, which is typically used to support the Metal Tower...!</ScenarioTalk24_63>
    <ScenarioTalk24_64>I bet they realized the ability of the "Stone Heart" and are using it for malicious purposes.</ScenarioTalk24_64>
    <ScenarioTalk24_65>- Florence nodded and opened her mouth -</ScenarioTalk24_65>
    <ScenarioTalk24_66>Same here! Spirit attacks were effective against those bastards!!</ScenarioTalk24_66>
    <ScenarioTalk24_67>But there was something strange!!</ScenarioTalk24_67>
    <ScenarioTalk24_68>- Strange? -</ScenarioTalk24_68>
    <ScenarioTalk24_69>They were going after our spirits from the start... It was not a typical raid...</ScenarioTalk24_69>
    <ScenarioTalk24_70>- Arnold agreed -</ScenarioTalk24_70>
    <ScenarioTalk24_71>I can't believe that I agreed with this idiot! Hahaha!! Yes! That's what I thought as well!!</ScenarioTalk24_71>
    <ScenarioTalk24_72>Their goal was to seize the machines!</ScenarioTalk24_72>
    <ScenarioTalk24_73>It looked like they had a different agenda... Yeah... A hidden agenda!!</ScenarioTalk24_73>
    <ScenarioTalk24_74>I bet you can't tell us more given your limited brain capacity?</ScenarioTalk24_74>
    <ScenarioTalk24_75>What did you say?!</ScenarioTalk24_75>
    <ScenarioTalk24_76>- You stopped the fight and put their stories together -</ScenarioTalk24_76>
    <ScenarioTalk24_77>- Both continents sent people over once the Barrier weakened... and both groups were attacked by these mysterious ghost pirates -</ScenarioTalk24_77>
    <ScenarioTalk24_78>- But they weren't alive and had a hidden agenda for the attacks... -</ScenarioTalk24_78>
    <ScenarioTalk24_79>- The goal of these raids was to steal the machines and the spirits... And their final destination is Yutakan-</ScenarioTalk24_79>
    <ScenarioTalk24_80>Oh... yeah... They might be here already!</ScenarioTalk24_80>
    <ScenarioTalk24_81>They must have an agenda... Something to do with the spirits and machines...!!</ScenarioTalk24_81>
    <ScenarioTalk24_82>I will help you out... I need to get my machine back!</ScenarioTalk24_82>
    <ScenarioTalk24_83>I will try my best as well!</ScenarioTalk24_83>
    <ScenarioTalk24_84>Your cheap tricks won't help anyone! Haha.</ScenarioTalk24_84>
    <ScenarioTalk24_85>Speak for yourself! Don't become a burden on us with your short legs!</ScenarioTalk24_85>
    <ScenarioTalk24_86>- Once again, those two were going after each other -</ScenarioTalk24_86>
    <ScenarioTalk24_87>- You need more information... Let's head back to the village first -</ScenarioTalk24_87>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk25_1>Ah....Who are they?</ScenarioTalk25_1>
    <ScenarioTalk25_2>Wow! You look gorgeous! How are you doing?!!</ScenarioTalk25_2>
    <ScenarioTalk25_3>Hi... Nice to meet you!</ScenarioTalk25_3>
    <ScenarioTalk25_4>- You introduced the two to Yulia and told her about what happened in the Underwater Cave. -</ScenarioTalk25_4>
    <ScenarioTalk25_5>- Yulia looked perplexed -</ScenarioTalk25_5>
    <ScenarioTalk25_6>To give you a quick summary, a big explosion in Yutakan could be seen from two other continents </ScenarioTalk25_6>
    <ScenarioTalk25_7>And while the first group of troops were on their journey to Yutakan... They were attacked by ghost pirates who robbed them of their weapons, machines and spirits...</ScenarioTalk25_7>
    <ScenarioTalk25_8>The goal of this raid was evident...</ScenarioTalk25_8>
    <ScenarioTalk25_9>And they are heading over here now...!</ScenarioTalk25_9>
    <ScenarioTalk25_10>Wow! You are not only pretty but also very smart!</ScenarioTalk25_10>
    <ScenarioTalk25_11>Yes! Attractiveness and intelligence go hand in hand!</ScenarioTalk25_11>
    <ScenarioTalk25_12>That's why you are so ugly!</ScenarioTalk25_12>
    <ScenarioTalk25_13>You would be great if only you stopped talking!!</ScenarioTalk25_13>
    <ScenarioTalk25_14>What did you say?!!</ScenarioTalk25_14>
    <ScenarioTalk25_15>You heard me!</ScenarioTalk25_15>
    <ScenarioTalk25_16>So... The unknown strong forces that G-Skull mentioned... were machines, spirits and mysterious enemies...!!</ScenarioTalk25_16>
    <ScenarioTalk25_17>- You simply nodded... -</ScenarioTalk25_17>
    <ScenarioTalk25_18>That is surprising.... The great war between two mighty guardians,</ScenarioTalk25_18>
    <ScenarioTalk25_19>The Ancient Divine Dragon and Dark Nix, weakened Yutakan's Barrier...</ScenarioTalk25_19>
    <ScenarioTalk25_20>There are other continents... And outsiders weren't previously able to approach Yutakan due to power of the Barriers...</ScenarioTalk25_20>
    
    <ScenarioTalk25_21>I wonder who built the Barrier...</ScenarioTalk25_21>
    <ScenarioTalk25_22>For what purpose? To protect against what?</ScenarioTalk25_22>
    <ScenarioTalk25_23>Hmm... We can think about that later... First, we need to solve the problem on our hands...</ScenarioTalk25_23>
    <ScenarioTalk25_24>- Arnold and Florence agreed -</ScenarioTalk25_24>
    
    <ScenarioTalk25_25>Hmm... I wonder where the Ghost Pirates are now.</ScenarioTalk25_25>
    <ScenarioTalk25_26>I don't think you need to wonder any more.</ScenarioTalk25_26>
    <ScenarioTalk25_27>What are you talking about? You sneaky long ears.</ScenarioTalk25_27>
    <ScenarioTalk25_28>Well... what I'm saying is that since we're the intelligent ones here... why don't you do the physical work?</ScenarioTalk25_28>
    <ScenarioTalk25_29>What did you say?</ScenarioTalk25_29>
    <ScenarioTalk25_30>- You calmed down Arnold and Florence... who seemed like they were about to tear each other apart -</ScenarioTalk25_30>
    <ScenarioTalk25_31>I'll work alone. I don't think I can stand this foul smelling sack of ...</ScenarioTalk25_31>
    <ScenarioTalk25_32>Hey... that's my line! You pointy ear rascal! Hey... let's split up!</ScenarioTalk25_32>
    <ScenarioTalk25_33>- Both Arnold and Florence disappeared from your sight before you got a chance to say a word. -</ScenarioTalk25_33>
    <ScenarioTalk25_34>- ...First... you should search the entire area of Yutakan, one section at a time. -</ScenarioTalk25_34>
    <ScenarioTalk25_35>- May be you will find a clue. -</ScenarioTalk25_35>
    <ScenarioTalk25_36>- Florence and Arnold came towards you with weakened expression. -</ScenarioTalk25_36>
    <ScenarioTalk25_37>Sorry... I didn't find anything about Ghost Pirates.</ScenarioTalk25_37>
    <ScenarioTalk25_38>Puff! Me too! These rotten ghosts! Where have they all gone to?</ScenarioTalk25_38>
    <ScenarioTalk25_39>Well... just so that you know. I searched harder than this pointy ear!</ScenarioTalk25_39>
    <ScenarioTalk25_40>What? Hey look here you sack of ....!</ScenarioTalk25_40>
    <ScenarioTalk25_41>What did you call me?</ScenarioTalk25_41>
    <ScenarioTalk25_42>- Arnold and Florence started to go at it again. -</ScenarioTalk25_42>
    <ScenarioTalk25_43>- Well... anyway... it's amazing that they have all just vanished without a trace. Do you think there's a 3rd party helping the Ghost Pirates? -</ScenarioTalk25_43>
    <ScenarioTalk25_44>- Well... let's return to Yulia and reorganize. -</ScenarioTalk25_44>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk26_1>That's a great sign... The war between the Ancient Divine Dragon and Dark Nix weakening the Barrier</ScenarioTalk26_1>
    <ScenarioTalk26_2>I am finally back... Hehehehehe!!</ScenarioTalk26_2>
    <ScenarioTalk26_3>...You look happy...</ScenarioTalk26_3>
    <ScenarioTalk26_4>I can't give you more details... But my wishes are coming true one by one...!!</ScenarioTalk26_4>
    <ScenarioTalk26_5>What about our arrangement? Release me from this horrible curse!!!</ScenarioTalk26_5>
    <ScenarioTalk26_6>...Did you attack the dwarves using the information I gave you?</ScenarioTalk26_6>
    <ScenarioTalk26_7>Yes... Dwarves and elves showed up just like you said......</ScenarioTalk26_7>
    <ScenarioTalk26_8>They were very weak... but!</ScenarioTalk26_8>
    <ScenarioTalk26_9>The machines and spirits were pretty strong...?!</ScenarioTalk26_9>
    <ScenarioTalk26_10>Yes... We lost a couple of soldiers in the battle.</ScenarioTalk26_10>
    <ScenarioTalk26_11>You need to keep your promise!! This better be worth more than the soldiers we lost in the battle!!!</ScenarioTalk26_11>
    <ScenarioTalk26_12>Yeah, yeah... I will keep my promise on my end! But... You haven't finished the job yet!!</ScenarioTalk26_12>
    <ScenarioTalk26_13>No way! I stole the machines and spirits and came to Yutakan as agreed...!</ScenarioTalk26_13>
    <ScenarioTalk26_14>The Barrier is still fatal to us... What else do you want?</ScenarioTalk26_14>
    <ScenarioTalk26_15>Calm down... I have everything set up perfectly... We just have to execute it according to plan...</ScenarioTalk26_15>
    <ScenarioTalk26_16>Let's test it out first... Then I will comply with your demands...</ScenarioTalk26_16>
    <ScenarioTalk26_17>Hahahahaha!!</ScenarioTalk26_17>
    <ScenarioTalk26_18>.......</ScenarioTalk26_18>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk27_1>He is crazy. What is he thinking?</ScenarioTalk27_1>
    <ScenarioTalk27_2>I don't care..! We simply follow orders!</ScenarioTalk27_2>
    <ScenarioTalk27_3>Would he really...?</ScenarioTalk27_3>
    <ScenarioTalk27_4>Shut up! Finish your work! Do you see the monsters over there??!!</ScenarioTalk27_4>
    <ScenarioTalk27_5>That one will do!!</ScenarioTalk27_5>
    <ScenarioTalk27_6>I have been looking everywhere.... but I can't find any clues!</ScenarioTalk27_6>
    <ScenarioTalk27_7>...Nothing? Same here... This is frustrating</ScenarioTalk27_7>
    <ScenarioTalk27_8>- You haven't found anything either. This is a mystery... -</ScenarioTalk27_8>
    <ScenarioTalk27_9>What...What's going on?</ScenarioTalk27_9>
    <ScenarioTalk27_10>??</ScenarioTalk27_10>
    <ScenarioTalk27_11>We are in trouble!!</ScenarioTalk27_11>
    <ScenarioTalk27_12>There is a monster at the Crystal Mine!!</ScenarioTalk27_12>
    <ScenarioTalk27_13>Is the Egg speaking...?</ScenarioTalk27_13>
    <ScenarioTalk27_14>I am a dragon!!!</ScenarioTalk27_14>
    <ScenarioTalk27_15>Anyway! Quickly!! There is a monster at the Crystal Mine!</ScenarioTalk27_15>
    <ScenarioTalk27_16>- You told him that it is normal to see a monster at the mine -</ScenarioTalk27_16>
    <ScenarioTalk27_17>No... This one is crazy and out of control... It's even attacking its own kind!!</ScenarioTalk27_17>
    <ScenarioTalk27_18>It looked... very strange! Covered with some kind of iron material!!</ScenarioTalk27_18>
    <ScenarioTalk27_19>!!!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk27_19>
    <ScenarioTalk27_20>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk27_20>
    <ScenarioTalk27_21>No way...!!</ScenarioTalk27_21>
    <ScenarioTalk27_22>Lead the way!! Right now!!</ScenarioTalk27_22>
    <ScenarioTalk27_23>Let's follow them!!</ScenarioTalk27_23>
    <ScenarioTalk27_24>Sure!!</ScenarioTalk27_24>
    <ScenarioTalk27_25>- Arnold and Florence stopped abruptly -</ScenarioTalk27_25>
    <ScenarioTalk27_26>- Both of them seemed shocked -</ScenarioTalk27_26>
    <ScenarioTalk27_27>What...What is that?!!!</ScenarioTalk27_27>
    <ScenarioTalk27_28>That is cruel... What is he doing?!!</ScenarioTalk27_28>
    <ScenarioTalk27_29>- You turned your head to see what Arnold and Florence were looking at... Mandragonak? ...But something was different!! -</ScenarioTalk27_29>
    <ScenarioTalk27_30>Kwaaaeeeekkkk!! Kwaaakkkkkk!!</ScenarioTalk27_30>
    <ScenarioTalk27_31>- Mandragonak stormed at you like a maniac -</ScenarioTalk27_31>
    <ScenarioTalk27_32>Kaaaaeekkkkkk!!!</ScenarioTalk27_32>
    <ScenarioTalk27_33>Gosh... damn it...!! What happened here? Someone has attached a machine onto a creature by force!!! That is absolutely nuts!!!</ScenarioTalk27_33>
    <ScenarioTalk27_34>That must be one of the stolen machines... Hmm... What is this shiny piece of metal?!</ScenarioTalk27_34>
    <ScenarioTalk27_35>This is a piece of the "Stone Heart"... Definitely from the dwarves' machine... How could anybody do this...?!!</ScenarioTalk27_35>
    <ScenarioTalk27_36>I thought the machines were supposed to be very strong...</ScenarioTalk27_36>
    <ScenarioTalk27_37>...Of course! The machine was forced onto a living creature!!!</ScenarioTalk27_37>
    <ScenarioTalk27_38>That is impossible... the monster can't handle the power of machine!! You saw it. That monster was out of his mind!!!</ScenarioTalk27_38>
    <ScenarioTalk27_39>- That is the result of a horrible experiment... Mandragonak has already passed out from using too much energy -</ScenarioTalk27_39>
    <ScenarioTalk27_40> Who is responsible for this evil act?</ScenarioTalk27_40>
    <ScenarioTalk27_41>No... Are they doing this to my spirit too?...</ScenarioTalk27_41>
    <ScenarioTalk27_42>- After calming down Florence, you looked around to scan our surroundings -</ScenarioTalk27_42>
    <ScenarioTalk27_43>- This must be an experiment of some sort... There are signs of struggle and disturbance everywhere -</ScenarioTalk27_43>
    <ScenarioTalk27_44>- What are they after? -</ScenarioTalk27_44>
    <ScenarioTalk27_45>Ah... You are walking too fast for me...</ScenarioTalk27_45>
    <ScenarioTalk27_46>What...What is going on here...?!</ScenarioTalk27_46>
    <ScenarioTalk27_47>Who are they?</ScenarioTalk27_47>
    <ScenarioTalk27_48>Why don't you introduce them? Starting with that talking Egg...</ScenarioTalk27_48>
    <ScenarioTalk27_49>- You introduced Arnold and Florence to Nuri and Jimon -</ScenarioTalk27_49>
    <ScenarioTalk27_50>Really? ...A Barrier surrounding the Yutakan Island? More continents?</ScenarioTalk27_50>
    <ScenarioTalk27_51>And a ghost ship... I am so lost now...</ScenarioTalk27_51>
    <ScenarioTalk27_52>This is exactly what G-Skull mentioned before! Something strong was heading here from the sea!!</ScenarioTalk27_52>
    <ScenarioTalk27_53>Are you saying that they are coming here now, as we speak?!</ScenarioTalk27_53>
    <ScenarioTalk27_54>- You nodded -</ScenarioTalk27_54>
    <ScenarioTalk27_55>But... What are they looking for? This atrocity is beyond anything I have ever witnessed before...!</ScenarioTalk27_55>
    <ScenarioTalk27_56>Hmmm. I don't know yet...</ScenarioTalk27_56>
    <ScenarioTalk27_57>- You heard footsteps coming from a distance -</ScenarioTalk27_57>
    <ScenarioTalk27_58>Hey!! Something bad has happened!!! Something very bad!!</ScenarioTalk27_58>
    <ScenarioTalk27_59>Kanggalo? Calm down, what's going on?!</ScenarioTalk27_59>
    <ScenarioTalk27_60>Yulia never came back from the Rainbow Forest!!!!</ScenarioTalk27_60>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk28_1>Kwaaeeekk!!!</ScenarioTalk28_1>
    <ScenarioTalk28_2>What is that?!!</ScenarioTalk28_2>
    <ScenarioTalk28_3>Oh my God...!!</ScenarioTalk28_3>
    <ScenarioTalk28_4>- A strange haze is circling around the body of Spike Gel -</ScenarioTalk28_4>
    <ScenarioTalk28_5>What is that red aura?!!</ScenarioTalk28_5>
    <ScenarioTalk28_6>I have a bad feeling about this!</ScenarioTalk28_6>
    <ScenarioTalk28_7>It's the Fire Spirit... the spirit is inside that monster's body.</ScenarioTalk28_7>
    <ScenarioTalk28_8>But the spirit has gone insane... No way... That is impossible!!!</ScenarioTalk28_8>
    <ScenarioTalk28_9>Are you saying that a spirit has been forced onto a monster, like the machine earlier?</ScenarioTalk28_9>
    <ScenarioTalk28_10>.......Yes</ScenarioTalk28_10>
    <ScenarioTalk28_11>We can talk all we want but....Watch out!!</ScenarioTalk28_11>
    <ScenarioTalk28_12>- Spike Gel is storming toward us! -</ScenarioTalk28_12>
    <ScenarioTalk28_13>It's getting closer!!!</ScenarioTalk28_13>
    <ScenarioTalk28_14>How can anyone do such a horrible thing...?</ScenarioTalk28_14>
    <ScenarioTalk28_15>First machine, and then spirit... Both of them have been forced onto the monsters...</ScenarioTalk28_15>
    <ScenarioTalk28_16>As if someone was testing, to figure out a perfect combination...</ScenarioTalk28_16>
    <ScenarioTalk28_17>Combination?!</ScenarioTalk28_17>
    <ScenarioTalk28_18>Yes... They were experimenting with our weapons...</ScenarioTalk28_18>
    
    <ScenarioTalk28_19>Oh... No...</ScenarioTalk28_19>
    <ScenarioTalk28_20>Ah... Aaaahhhhh... No!!</ScenarioTalk28_20>
    <ScenarioTalk28_21>- The Fire Spirit appeared as the flame subsided -</ScenarioTalk28_21>
    <ScenarioTalk28_22>- Florence turned pale from the shock of atrocity and walked over to the Fire Spirit -</ScenarioTalk28_22>
    <ScenarioTalk28_23>- Florence spoke while holding on to the fainted spirit -</ScenarioTalk28_23>
    <ScenarioTalk28_24>I will never forgive them... for this atrocity!!</ScenarioTalk28_24>
    <ScenarioTalk28_25>But we don't have any evidence...</ScenarioTalk28_25>
    <ScenarioTalk28_26>But, most importantly, we can't find Yulia...</ScenarioTalk28_26>
    <ScenarioTalk28_27>Let's spread out and look for Yulia! She might be in danger...!!</ScenarioTalk28_27>
    <ScenarioTalk28_28>I agree! Scream if anything happens to you guys! I will come to you ASAP!!</ScenarioTalk28_28>
    <ScenarioTalk28_29>Sounds good!!</ScenarioTalk28_29>
    <ScenarioTalk28_30>- Everyone scattered in different directions...!! -</ScenarioTalk28_30>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk29_1>Here you are... It is you!!!</ScenarioTalk29_1>
    <ScenarioTalk29_2>Oh... Look who it is! Long time no see... Yulia?</ScenarioTalk29_2>
    <ScenarioTalk29_3>What are you plotting?!</ScenarioTalk29_3>
    <ScenarioTalk29_4>Don't worry. I won't hurt you... Is this how you treat your old friends?!</ScenarioTalk29_4>
    <ScenarioTalk29_5>Shut up! You know I don't mean that!!</ScenarioTalk29_5>
    <ScenarioTalk29_6>Hmm... Okay...</ScenarioTalk29_6>
    <ScenarioTalk29_7>!!</ScenarioTalk29_7>
    <ScenarioTalk29_8>...Yutakan has changed you... You are too soft!!</ScenarioTalk29_8>
    <ScenarioTalk29_9>Hey, you are the one who asked me to stay here!</ScenarioTalk29_9>
    <ScenarioTalk29_10>...I would hate for your talent to go to waste... Either way... The outcome will be as predicted!</ScenarioTalk29_10>
    <ScenarioTalk29_11>Are you sure?</ScenarioTalk29_11>
    <ScenarioTalk29_12>What do you mean?</ScenarioTalk29_12>
    <ScenarioTalk29_13>What if....what if he stops you..?!</ScenarioTalk29_13>
    <ScenarioTalk29_14>Nonsense! Why are you holding on to false hope?</ScenarioTalk29_14>
    <ScenarioTalk29_15>If you keep up this nonsense, I can't guarantee your safety!</ScenarioTalk29_15>
    <ScenarioTalk29_16>Ah! I have an idea... Why don't I use you in an experiment?</ScenarioTalk29_16>
    <ScenarioTalk29_17>!!?!</ScenarioTalk29_17>
    <ScenarioTalk29_18>Don't resist and follow me... He has been waiting for you!!</ScenarioTalk29_18>
    <ScenarioTalk29_19>!!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk29_19>
    <ScenarioTalk29_20>- You stepped in between them and stood in front of the mystery man. -</ScenarioTalk29_20>
    <ScenarioTalk29_21>Who do you think you are...? ...Oh... I see...</ScenarioTalk29_21>
    <ScenarioTalk29_22>..........</ScenarioTalk29_22>
    <ScenarioTalk29_23>This is the one you trust? That's interesting! Let me test him!</ScenarioTalk29_23>
    
    <ScenarioTalk29_24>Kkkkaeek~!</ScenarioTalk29_24>
    
    <ScenarioTalk29_25>!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk29_25>
    <ScenarioTalk29_26>I can't believe that a Dragon Tamer of this caliber still exists... I underestimated you... But he is still not strong enough to take me! This is fun!</ScenarioTalk29_26>
    <ScenarioTalk29_27>This can come back to bite me later... but he is fascinating! Okay, I will give you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity</ScenarioTalk29_27>
    <ScenarioTalk29_28>....to participate in my experiment!!</ScenarioTalk29_28>
    <ScenarioTalk29_29>!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk29_29>
    <ScenarioTalk29_30>You bastard!!! Stop it!!</ScenarioTalk29_30>
    <ScenarioTalk29_31>Eat this!!</ScenarioTalk29_31>
    <ScenarioTalk29_32>Aajajajajat!!</ScenarioTalk29_32>
    <ScenarioTalk29_33>Boring... Anyway, we are ready and everything is in motion!</ScenarioTalk29_33>
    <ScenarioTalk29_34>Try your best to keep up with my experiment! Hahaha!!</ScenarioTalk29_34>
    <ScenarioTalk29_35>- ...You have no strength -</ScenarioTalk29_35>
    <ScenarioTalk29_36>- Losing consciousness..... -</ScenarioTalk29_36>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk30_1>I did everything you asked. Release me from the curse now!</ScenarioTalk30_1>
    <ScenarioTalk30_2>...Before I kill you, there is one thing that you have to do...</ScenarioTalk30_2>
    <ScenarioTalk30_3>What the... what are you talking about?</ScenarioTalk30_3>
    <ScenarioTalk30_4>Take a look!</ScenarioTalk30_4>
    <ScenarioTalk30_5>Dark Frosty?!</ScenarioTalk30_5>
    <ScenarioTalk30_6>That's a dragon! You fool! What have you done...!! Did you combine machine with spirit?!?!</ScenarioTalk30_6>
    <ScenarioTalk30_7>After a series of experiments, I needed something stronger than a regular creature... Like a dragon...</ScenarioTalk30_7>
    <ScenarioTalk30_8>It was very successful, with limited resistance and side effects!!</ScenarioTalk30_8>
    <ScenarioTalk30_9>Ugh!!... What do you want?</ScenarioTalk30_9>
    <ScenarioTalk30_10>It's very simple... I need a victim to test its power...</ScenarioTalk30_10>
    <ScenarioTalk30_11>...No way! You crook! You deceived us!!!</ScenarioTalk30_11>
    <ScenarioTalk30_12>No... I will release you from the curse... forever... Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk30_12>
    <ScenarioTalk30_13>Okay! Let's initiate the test!!</ScenarioTalk30_13>
    <ScenarioTalk30_14>Krrrrrrrr!!!! Kkkkoooooohhhh!!!!</ScenarioTalk30_14>
    <ScenarioTalk30_15>No...!! Aaaahhhhhhh!!</ScenarioTalk30_15>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk31_1>I tried to tell you before, but.</ScenarioTalk31_1>
    <ScenarioTalk31_2>- Yulia opened her mouth after much consideration -</ScenarioTalk31_2>
    <ScenarioTalk31_3>I once practiced dark magic.</ScenarioTalk31_3>
    <ScenarioTalk31_4>Of course! That's only to enhance my ability.&#10;Simple greed... that's all.</ScenarioTalk31_4>
    <ScenarioTalk31_5>Then I joined a mysterious group to improve my skills even further.</ScenarioTalk31_5>
    <ScenarioTalk31_6>- Mysterious? -</ScenarioTalk31_6>
    <ScenarioTalk31_7>But what I witnessed was more than I could handle... I still have nightmares...</ScenarioTalk31_7>
    <ScenarioTalk31_8>They committed all sorts of crimes for their own benefits...</ScenarioTalk31_8>
    <ScenarioTalk31_9>After a while, I finally got away from them and came to Yutakan.</ScenarioTalk31_9>
    <ScenarioTalk31_10>And quickly forgot about my past with the help of generous, warm-hearted villagers...</ScenarioTalk31_10>
    <ScenarioTalk31_11>- How did you get out of that place? -</ScenarioTalk31_11>
    <ScenarioTalk31_12>There was a big riot... I can't remember what it was.</ScenarioTalk31_12>
    <ScenarioTalk31_13>It was a ceremony to hatch something dangerous.</ScenarioTalk31_13>
    <ScenarioTalk31_14>But the experiment failed... and everyone scattered all over the world...</ScenarioTalk31_14>
    <ScenarioTalk31_15>But... the guy wearing a robe was definitely one of the members</ScenarioTalk31_15>
    <ScenarioTalk31_16>They may have regrouped to start another evil plot.</ScenarioTalk31_16>
    <ScenarioTalk31_17>- You asked for more details about the plot -</ScenarioTalk31_17>
    <ScenarioTalk31_18>They are plotting something using the dwarves' machines and elves' spirits!</ScenarioTalk31_18>
    <ScenarioTalk31_19>Based on the fusion experiments we witnessed....They might be turning themselves into living weapons...</ScenarioTalk31_19>
    <ScenarioTalk31_20>If all we heard is true, they have prepared everything already...</ScenarioTalk31_20>
    <ScenarioTalk31_21>Ah... We are in trouble!!</ScenarioTalk31_21>
    <ScenarioTalk31_22>What?!!</ScenarioTalk31_22>
    <ScenarioTalk31_23>...Ah, before! There was a sudden explosion with a flash of light in the Underwater Cave!</ScenarioTalk31_23>
    <ScenarioTalk31_24>Arnold, Florence, Nuri and Jimon went to check out the explosion... But no one's come back yet...!!</ScenarioTalk31_24>
    <ScenarioTalk31_25>- You rushed out! -</ScenarioTalk31_25>
    <ScenarioTalk31_26>It's a trap! You will be killed!!</ScenarioTalk31_26>
    <ScenarioTalk31_27>- You ignored Yulia's advice and headed toward the cave -</ScenarioTalk31_27>
    <ScenarioTalk31_28>- You need to stop him! -</ScenarioTalk31_28>
    
    <ScenarioTalk32_1>- Arnold, Florence, Nuri and Jimon were passed out on the ground! -</ScenarioTalk32_1>
    <ScenarioTalk32_2>Ohh... We meet again... You are just in time....I am cheering for you. Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk32_2>
    <ScenarioTalk32_3>Dark Frosty!!!</ScenarioTalk32_3>
    <ScenarioTalk32_4>- Dark Frosty had been combined with a machine and a spirit... He was out of his mind. -</ScenarioTalk32_4>
    <ScenarioTalk32_5>Krrrrrrrr</ScenarioTalk32_5>
    <ScenarioTalk32_6>- No! -</ScenarioTalk32_6>
    <ScenarioTalk32_7>Kkkkkkkkooooo!!!</ScenarioTalk32_7>
    <ScenarioTalk32_8>Hahaha!! Perfect! It came out better than I expected!!!!</ScenarioTalk32_8>
    <ScenarioTalk32_9>We just have to produce them in large quantities... Huh?!</ScenarioTalk32_9>
    <ScenarioTalk32_10>Kwoooooooo</ScenarioTalk32_10>
    <ScenarioTalk32_11>- Dark Frosty attacked Dark Robe -</ScenarioTalk32_11>
    <ScenarioTalk32_12>What?! I can't control him. Whatever! This is good enough... Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk32_12>
    <ScenarioTalk32_13>This is even better... Go nuts, Dark Frosty!! This is one for the ages!!</ScenarioTalk32_13>
    <ScenarioTalk32_14>- With loud laughter, Dark Robe disappeared into the darkness -</ScenarioTalk32_14>
    <ScenarioTalk32_15>- Roaring, Dark Frosty flew away to the Windy Valley -</ScenarioTalk32_15>
    <ScenarioTalk32_16>- And just about when you start to lose conscious, you hear a voice -</ScenarioTalk32_16>
    <ScenarioTalk32_17>...!!</ScenarioTalk32_17>
    <ScenarioTalk32_18>No......!!</ScenarioTalk32_18>
    <ScenarioTalk32_19>Are you awake?</ScenarioTalk32_19>
    <ScenarioTalk32_20>- Yulia and Popo were anxiously staring down at me -</ScenarioTalk32_20>
    <ScenarioTalk32_21>- Luckily, you weren't hurt that bad. You need to stop... -</ScenarioTalk32_21>
    <ScenarioTalk32_22>Everyone is still recovering... You should... Hey, stop moving!</ScenarioTalk32_22>
    <ScenarioTalk32_23>If you move now... </ScenarioTalk32_23>
    <ScenarioTalk32_24>- You asked them about ways to stop Dark Frosty -</ScenarioTalk32_24>
    <ScenarioTalk32_25>Hmmm... I really don't know...</ScenarioTalk32_25>
    <ScenarioTalk32_26>- Arnold and Florence woke up from their beds -</ScenarioTalk32_26>
    <ScenarioTalk32_27>They took us by storm... I didn't know what to say... I am so embarrassed...</ScenarioTalk32_27>
    <ScenarioTalk32_28>Hey! Don't worry! I am stronger than I look! Ouch...</ScenarioTalk32_28>
    <ScenarioTalk32_29>But it wasn't for nothing. I learned that the crazy Dark Frosty was a result of the forced fusion of spirit and machine!</ScenarioTalk32_29>
    <ScenarioTalk32_30>Even the strongest dragon has a weakness!</ScenarioTalk32_30>
    <ScenarioTalk32_31>This will help you beat him!!</ScenarioTalk32_31>
    <ScenarioTalk32_32>I shall grant you my blessing!</ScenarioTalk32_32>
    <ScenarioTalk32_33>The blessing will defend you against the spirits... But you won't be 100% immune to their attacks!</ScenarioTalk32_33>
    <ScenarioTalk32_34>- Arnold taught me the monster's weakness -</ScenarioTalk32_34>
    <ScenarioTalk32_35>- Florence put a blessing spell on me -</ScenarioTalk32_35>
    <ScenarioTalk32_36>Okay! Now that you know his weakness, beating him should be a piece of cake!</ScenarioTalk32_36>
    <ScenarioTalk32_37>If you have the courage to fight against him, you will beat him this time! I have faith in you!!</ScenarioTalk32_37>
    <ScenarioTalk32_38>God, please help us... and protect him...!</ScenarioTalk32_38>
    <ScenarioTalk32_39>- Yulia approached you when you looked back -</ScenarioTalk32_39>
    <ScenarioTalk32_40>Dark Frosty, spirit and machine...</ScenarioTalk32_40>
    <ScenarioTalk32_41>They are just poor souls being played by this evil monster.</ScenarioTalk32_41>
    <ScenarioTalk32_42>Please kill him...</ScenarioTalk32_42>
    <ScenarioTalk32_43>- You nodded with a big smile on your face -</ScenarioTalk32_43>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk33_1>- You hear a monster screaming from a mile away... Along with the sound of wind... -</ScenarioTalk33_1>
    <ScenarioTalk33_2>- The screaming was starting to sound like mourning as you got closer -</ScenarioTalk33_2>
    <ScenarioTalk33_3>Ohh... You again? I admire you for coming back after that pathetic loss!</ScenarioTalk33_3>
    <ScenarioTalk33_4>I can see why Yulia thought highly of you...! But I won't go easy on you this time...!</ScenarioTalk33_4>
    <ScenarioTalk33_5>Well... He can't be controlled, but this should be provide some interesting data for my records...</ScenarioTalk33_5>
    <ScenarioTalk33_6>I look forward to watching you entertain me with your reckless bravery! Hahaha!!</ScenarioTalk33_6>
    <ScenarioTalk33_7>Kkooooooo!!!</ScenarioTalk33_7>
    <ScenarioTalk33_8>- You must stop him here!! -</ScenarioTalk33_8>
    <ScenarioTalk33_9>- You need to exploit his weakness -</ScenarioTalk33_9>
    <ScenarioTalk33_10>- You must maximize the power of the blessings given by Lorens! -</ScenarioTalk33_10>
    
    <ScenarioTalk33_11>Kooong...Ohhhhhh....</ScenarioTalk33_11>
    <ScenarioTalk33_12>- Dark Frosty fell... -</ScenarioTalk33_12>
    <ScenarioTalk33_13>- The machine and the spirit lost their power and separated from Dark Frosty -</ScenarioTalk33_13>
    <ScenarioTalk33_14>Huh, that was a surprise... Those worthless clowns must have helped him out...</ScenarioTalk33_14>
    <ScenarioTalk33_15>Well, this was a great experiment... Thanks for your help!</ScenarioTalk33_15>
    <ScenarioTalk33_16>- The sound of an arrow flying through the air broke the silence -</ScenarioTalk33_16>
    <ScenarioTalk33_17>You bastard!!</ScenarioTalk33_17>
    <ScenarioTalk33_18>You devil!!!</ScenarioTalk33_18>
    <ScenarioTalk33_19>- Dark Robe stepped back as Arnold swung his axe -</ScenarioTalk33_19>
    <ScenarioTalk33_20>Huh! ...I thought you guys were dead... What do I have to do to kill you?!</ScenarioTalk33_20>
    <ScenarioTalk33_21>- Nuri, Jimon and Yulia were running toward you -</ScenarioTalk33_21>
    <ScenarioTalk33_22>Hmmm...! Whatever! There will be other opportunities!!</ScenarioTalk33_22>
    
    <ScenarioTalk33_23>I will back off this time! But we will meet again... Dragon Tamer!</ScenarioTalk33_23>
    <ScenarioTalk33_24>Hahahahahaha!!</ScenarioTalk33_24>
    <ScenarioTalk33_25>No... Don't lose consciousness... Stay with us!!</ScenarioTalk33_25>
    <ScenarioTalk33_26>- As he disappeared into the darkness, you lost your strength and passed out... -</ScenarioTalk33_26>
    
    
    <!-- 다크프로스트 특수 시나리오 -->
    <ScenarioTalk1033_1>- Still strong as ever! -</ScenarioTalk1033_1>
    <ScenarioTalk1033_2>- But if you give up now, you will not be able to save anyone! You must defeat that monster! -</ScenarioTalk1033_2>
    <ScenarioTalk1033_3>Hmmm...His essence must be darkness. If I team up with a Dragon of Light, I could beat him...!!</ScenarioTalk1033_3>
    <ScenarioTalk1033_4>Hey!!</ScenarioTalk1033_4>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk34_1>Are you okay?</ScenarioTalk34_1>
    <ScenarioTalk34_2>Ahhh... How do I look?</ScenarioTalk34_2>
    <ScenarioTalk34_3>Hey, I thought you were dead... You scared me!! You were out for a long time!!</ScenarioTalk34_3>
    <ScenarioTalk34_4>No worries! I feel great! I am glad you are okay!!</ScenarioTalk34_4>
    <ScenarioTalk34_5>I heard! You fought against one of the most frightening monsters!</ScenarioTalk34_5>
    <ScenarioTalk34_6>Let's throw a party once you recover.</ScenarioTalk34_6>
    <ScenarioTalk34_7>Nonsense! I am ready to party right now!</ScenarioTalk34_7>
    <ScenarioTalk34_8>Hey... Come here everyone!</ScenarioTalk34_8>
    <ScenarioTalk34_9>- After everyone left the Sprit Lodge, Yulia slowly opened her mouth to speak -</ScenarioTalk34_9>
    <ScenarioTalk34_10>...It's safe now. Come out!</ScenarioTalk34_10>
    <ScenarioTalk34_11>- Arnold and Florence appeared behind the curtain -</ScenarioTalk34_11>
    <ScenarioTalk34_12>I am so sorry... This was all our fault...</ScenarioTalk34_12>
    <ScenarioTalk34_13>Thank you so much! I was able to retrieve my machine thanks to you!!</ScenarioTalk34_13>
    <ScenarioTalk34_14>Same here... I found my spirit. We owe you big time!!</ScenarioTalk34_14>
    <ScenarioTalk34_15>I don't know how to repay you for what you did... Thank you so much...</ScenarioTalk34_15>
    <ScenarioTalk34_16>- You asked if they found a way to return home -</ScenarioTalk34_16>
    <ScenarioTalk34_17>Don't worry! While you were unconscious, we sent a rescue signal back home... They should be coming soon...!!</ScenarioTalk34_17>
    <ScenarioTalk34_18>You were out for a while!</ScenarioTalk34_18>
    <ScenarioTalk34_19>I sent a rescue signal as well... Thank you so much!</ScenarioTalk34_19>
    <ScenarioTalk34_20>Arnold! Florence! Your ships are here!</ScenarioTalk34_20>
    <ScenarioTalk34_21>Hurry up!</ScenarioTalk34_21>
    <ScenarioTalk34_22>We will go with you.</ScenarioTalk34_22>
    <ScenarioTalk34_23>- You walked to the beach while being supported by Yulia. -</ScenarioTalk34_23>
    <ScenarioTalk34_24>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk34_24>
    <ScenarioTalk34_25>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk34_25>
    <ScenarioTalk34_26>There is no need for the formality, Arnold! I'm sorry for...!</ScenarioTalk34_26>
    <ScenarioTalk34_27>It means a lot to me that you have come all the way over here!!</ScenarioTalk34_27>
    <ScenarioTalk34_28>Florence, how are you doing?</ScenarioTalk34_28>
    <ScenarioTalk34_29>Great... I am honored that you have come here for me...!!</ScenarioTalk34_29>
    <ScenarioTalk34_30>- A white-bearded dwarf and a graceful elf walked toward us... -</ScenarioTalk34_30>
    <ScenarioTalk34_31>I have heard of you.... You saved our Arnold? Thank you so much...!</ScenarioTalk34_31>
    <ScenarioTalk34_32>I am Srorin, the King of the Dwarves and the Metal Tower! I can't thank you enough!!</ScenarioTalk34_32>
    <ScenarioTalk34_33>You are courageous and determined... just as Florence described.</ScenarioTalk34_33>
    <ScenarioTalk34_34>I am Aidra, Queen of the Elves and of Elysium</ScenarioTalk34_34>
    <ScenarioTalk34_35>We are forever indebted to you. Thank you...</ScenarioTalk34_35>
    <ScenarioTalk34_36>- You accepted their gratitude and bowed your head out of respect -</ScenarioTalk34_36>
    <ScenarioTalk34_37>Arnold! Say your goodbyes to everyone while we prepare for departure!!</ScenarioTalk34_37>
    <ScenarioTalk34_38>You will be busy once you return home... Say your farewells while you are here...</ScenarioTalk34_38>
    <ScenarioTalk34_39>Florence, we need you to help with some urgent matters in Elysium!</ScenarioTalk34_39>
    <ScenarioTalk34_40>We don't have much time before we leave... But take a couple of minutes to say your farewells to your friends and prepare for departure.</ScenarioTalk34_40>
    <ScenarioTalk34_41>Thank you, King Srorin... It won't take long!</ScenarioTalk34_41>
    <ScenarioTalk34_42>Thank you, Aidra! I will be there soon!!</ScenarioTalk34_42>
    <ScenarioTalk34_43>- Arnold and Florence slowly came over -</ScenarioTalk34_43>
    <ScenarioTalk34_44>I feel like I was a burden to you throughout this adventure... But it was fun!</ScenarioTalk34_44>
    <ScenarioTalk34_45>Of course it would've been better if this stiff elf wasn't here! Hahaha</ScenarioTalk34_45>
    <ScenarioTalk34_46>Yes! Lots of things happened... and we owe you! ...I would love to see you again!</ScenarioTalk34_46>
    <ScenarioTalk34_47>Of course, except for this midget dwarf...!</ScenarioTalk34_47>
    <ScenarioTalk34_48>- You grinned and replied  -</ScenarioTalk34_48>
    <ScenarioTalk34_49>Take care of yourself until we meet again!! I owe you!! My brother, the brave Dragon Tamer!!</ScenarioTalk34_49>
    <ScenarioTalk34_50>I hope the spirit of blessing and nature stays with you! Thank you again! Gentle and brave Dragon Tamer!</ScenarioTalk34_50>
    <ScenarioTalk34_51>- Arnold and Florence hopped aboard their respective vessels -</ScenarioTalk34_51>
    <ScenarioTalk34_52>- Both ships were ready to sail once all dwarves and elves got on board -</ScenarioTalk34_52>
    <ScenarioTalk34_53>You are always welcome at the Metal Tower, Brother!! Come visit me when you can!!!</ScenarioTalk34_53>
    <ScenarioTalk34_54>Please stop by Elysium too! You are always welcome to our land!!</ScenarioTalk34_54>
    <ScenarioTalk34_55>- It seemed like there was still some animosity between the two... Both boats were gone before sunset -</ScenarioTalk34_55>
    <ScenarioTalk34_56>- Nuri and Jimon slowly approached you -</ScenarioTalk34_56>
    <ScenarioTalk34_57>What are you doing? You are the man of the hour!!</ScenarioTalk34_57>
    <ScenarioTalk34_58>- There are many things you wanted to discuss... But let's enjoy this moment for now -</ScenarioTalk34_58>
    <ScenarioTalk34_59>- Against the backdrop of this peaceful paradise... -</ScenarioTalk34_59>
    <ScenarioTalk34_60>...Here are the exam results</ScenarioTalk34_60>
    <ScenarioTalk34_61>I heard that you found something interesting.</ScenarioTalk34_61>
    <ScenarioTalk34_62>Ah... You ran into an interesting Dragon Tamer</ScenarioTalk34_62>
    <ScenarioTalk34_63>....</ScenarioTalk34_63>
    <ScenarioTalk34_64>But he won't get in our way...He's just a kid.</ScenarioTalk34_64>
    <ScenarioTalk34_65>Okay... How about the elves and dwarves?</ScenarioTalk34_65>
    <ScenarioTalk34_66>The plan is on track...</ScenarioTalk34_66>
    <ScenarioTalk34_67>Good... We will hide in the darkness again... I will contact you when the time is right.</ScenarioTalk34_67>
    <ScenarioTalk34_68>Yes, master.</ScenarioTalk34_68>
    
    <ScenarioTalk34_69>I can really feal it.</ScenarioTalk34_69>
    <ScenarioTalk34_70>- ? -</ScenarioTalk34_70>
    <ScenarioTalk34_71>You aren't noticing that you're famous?</ScenarioTalk34_71>
    <ScenarioTalk34_72>You saved Yutakan from the Apostles of Black Robe, not too long ago.</ScenarioTalk34_72>
    <ScenarioTalk34_73>In a way... you're the most famous hero in Yutakan at the moment!</ScenarioTalk34_73>
    <ScenarioTalk34_74>Even when we were passing that village before... all the girls were staring at you!</ScenarioTalk34_74>
    <ScenarioTalk34_75>Well... of course you didn't notice them with such a gorgeous girl standing next to you!</ScenarioTalk34_75>
    <ScenarioTalk34_76>You need to have your mental health checked out.</ScenarioTalk34_76>
    <ScenarioTalk34_77>.......</ScenarioTalk34_77>
    <ScenarioTalk34_78>What the? Who's that?</ScenarioTalk34_78>
    <ScenarioTalk34_79>Humph! From the look of the smile on your face... you still need to grow up!</ScenarioTalk34_79>
    <ScenarioTalk34_80>- Raon? -</ScenarioTalk34_80>
    <ScenarioTalk34_81>It's OK to boast a bit after solving a huge case... but.</ScenarioTalk34_81>
    <ScenarioTalk34_82>I still can't believe the truth about what they say!</ScenarioTalk34_82>
    <ScenarioTalk34_83>What's that fool talking about?</ScenarioTalk34_83>
    <ScenarioTalk34_84>Yea! Show me what you've got! Right now! Let's go to Colosseum!</ScenarioTalk34_84>
    <ScenarioTalk34_85>Hey... you blue haired fool over there! I hate to disappoint you but we don't have time to play with you now.</ScenarioTalk34_85>
    <ScenarioTalk34_86>Well... let's go! Show me what you got, rival!</ScenarioTalk34_86>
    <ScenarioTalk34_87>- Raon just grabbed you and pulled you towards the Colosseum. -</ScenarioTalk34_87>
    <ScenarioTalk34_88>- Raon came out of the Colosseum with satisfied grim. -</ScenarioTalk34_88>
    <ScenarioTalk34_89>Great battle! You are worthy of being my rival.</ScenarioTalk34_89>
    <ScenarioTalk34_90>But if you let your guards down... I'll be there to snatch your victory. So always do your best!</ScenarioTalk34_90>
    <ScenarioTalk34_91>Don't slack off on your Dragon Duels every day!</ScenarioTalk34_91>
    <ScenarioTalk34_92>Until I beat you... that is. Well... so long!</ScenarioTalk34_92>
    <ScenarioTalk34_93>Puuha ha ha!!</ScenarioTalk34_93>
    <ScenarioTalk34_94>Something is definitely wrong with him...</ScenarioTalk34_94>
    <ScenarioTalk34_95>Maybe he just wants to be our friend.</ScenarioTalk34_95>
    <ScenarioTalk34_96>Is that how he makes friends?</ScenarioTalk34_96>
    <ScenarioTalk34_97>Well... I did say maybe.</ScenarioTalk34_97>
    <ScenarioTalk34_98>- Maybe it's a good idea to challenge Raon to a Dragon Duel sometimes. -</ScenarioTalk34_98>
    <ScenarioTalk34_99>- He seems like a nice guy. -</ScenarioTalk34_99>
    <ScenarioTalk34_100>Well... let's get going. We can't waste any more time.</ScenarioTalk34_100>
    <ScenarioTalk34_101>Yes! Time is gold!</ScenarioTalk34_101>
    <ScenarioTalk34_102>- You were quickly rushed by Nuri and Jimon. -</ScenarioTalk34_102>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk35_1>- The adventure with Florence and Arnold is still vivid in my mind -</ScenarioTalk35_1>
    <ScenarioTalk35_2>- Whenever you reminisce about the adventure, your heart rate goes up with the thought of excitement -</ScenarioTalk35_2>
    <ScenarioTalk35_3>Bro! Come visit me at the Metal Tower!! Promise me!</ScenarioTalk35_3>
    <ScenarioTalk35_4>Please come to Elysium! You are always welcome to stay at my place!!</ScenarioTalk35_4>
    <ScenarioTalk35_5>- Beyond the Barrier... -</ScenarioTalk35_5>
    <ScenarioTalk35_6>- Hmm... think about how to get to the Metal Tower and Elysium..? -</ScenarioTalk35_6>
    <ScenarioTalk35_7>What are you doing? With an empty look on your face like a fool!!</ScenarioTalk35_7>
    <ScenarioTalk35_8>What? I don't know what you are talking about!!</ScenarioTalk35_8>
    <ScenarioTalk35_9>Ouch!</ScenarioTalk35_9>
    <ScenarioTalk35_10>- Nuri and Jimon are arguing loudly behind. -</ScenarioTalk35_10>
    <ScenarioTalk35_11>- You sat down and started to mumble -</ScenarioTalk35_11>
    <ScenarioTalk35_12>- You want to go on an adventure... beyond the Barrier... to the Metal Tower and Elysium... -</ScenarioTalk35_12>
    <ScenarioTalk35_13>Beyond the Barrier?</ScenarioTalk35_13>
    <ScenarioTalk35_14>To the Metal Tower and Elysium?!</ScenarioTalk35_14>
    <ScenarioTalk35_15>- You simply nodded. -</ScenarioTalk35_15>
    <ScenarioTalk35_16>Hmm... You are not the only one thinking about it...!!</ScenarioTalk35_16>
    <ScenarioTalk35_17>- ? - </ScenarioTalk35_17>
    <ScenarioTalk35_18>We also think about that all the time!</ScenarioTalk35_18>
    <ScenarioTalk35_19>We've been trying to figure out a way to travel beyond the Barrier!!</ScenarioTalk35_19>
    <ScenarioTalk35_20>Like... Taking a Wind Dragon to fly over there...</ScenarioTalk35_20>
    <ScenarioTalk35_21>I was thinking about using a Aqua Dragon to swim there...</ScenarioTalk35_21>
    <ScenarioTalk35_22>- So... What happened?! -</ScenarioTalk35_22>
    <ScenarioTalk35_23>None of them worked!</ScenarioTalk35_23>
    <ScenarioTalk35_24>Dragons do not want to travel beyond the Barrier...</ScenarioTalk35_24>
    <ScenarioTalk35_25>They simply stopped at the Barrier and wouldn't move!</ScenarioTalk35_25>
    <ScenarioTalk35_26>Yes! As if they were scared of something...</ScenarioTalk35_26>
    <ScenarioTalk35_27> I think their instincts were telling them to avoid venturing beyond the Barrier.</ScenarioTalk35_27>
    <ScenarioTalk35_28>Ah... Even if we make it beyond the Barrier...</ScenarioTalk35_28>
    <ScenarioTalk35_29>How would we get to the Metal Tower and Elysium? We don't have a map...</ScenarioTalk35_29>
    <ScenarioTalk35_30>So... What are you trying to say?</ScenarioTalk35_30>
    <ScenarioTalk35_31>- ? -</ScenarioTalk35_31>
    <ScenarioTalk35_32>If you wanted to go beyond the Barrier, I bet you already found a map... Right?!</ScenarioTalk35_32>
    <ScenarioTalk35_33>- You shook your head from side to side -</ScenarioTalk35_33>
    <ScenarioTalk35_34>Hmmm... Maybe...!!</ScenarioTalk35_34>
    <ScenarioTalk35_35>It doesn't fit your character to keep your thoughts to yourself. Spit it out!</ScenarioTalk35_35>
    <ScenarioTalk35_36>Listen!!</ScenarioTalk35_36>
    <ScenarioTalk35_37>Sure~!</ScenarioTalk35_37>
    <ScenarioTalk35_38>Yulia might have an answer!</ScenarioTalk35_38>
    <ScenarioTalk35_39>She's mentioned a story about this before!!</ScenarioTalk35_39>
    <ScenarioTalk35_40>A story?</ScenarioTalk35_40>
    <ScenarioTalk35_41>I am not 100% sure...</ScenarioTalk35_41>
    <ScenarioTalk35_42>But it doesn't hurt to ask.</ScenarioTalk35_42>
    <ScenarioTalk35_43>Then. What are we waiting for?</ScenarioTalk35_43>
    <ScenarioTalk35_44>- ? -</ScenarioTalk35_44>
    <ScenarioTalk35_45>Haha! I got us this far. Now this is on you, Mr. Hero?!!</ScenarioTalk35_45>
    <ScenarioTalk35_46>- ...... -</ScenarioTalk35_46>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk36_1>Hmmm... Directions to the Metal Tower and Elysium...</ScenarioTalk36_1>
    <ScenarioTalk36_2>Even if we had a boat... We don't know how to get there...</ScenarioTalk36_2>
    <ScenarioTalk36_3>- After agonizing for a while, Yulia stormed out and brought back an old giant book -</ScenarioTalk36_3>
    <ScenarioTalk36_4>I was doing some research based on what Arnold and Florence told us...</ScenarioTalk36_4>
    <ScenarioTalk36_5>This is an ancient book written by disciples of the Ancient Divine Dragon</ScenarioTalk36_5>
    <ScenarioTalk36_6>Let's see...! Take a look at this paragraph!!</ScenarioTalk36_6>
    <ScenarioTalk36_7>- Yulia pointed toward an interesting phrase -</ScenarioTalk36_7>
    <ScenarioTalk36_8>We have records of people who went beyond the Barrier to seek help and fight against the monsters...</ScenarioTalk36_8>
    <ScenarioTalk36_9>- Beyond the Barrier... to the Metal Tower and Elysium! Really? -</ScenarioTalk36_9>
    <ScenarioTalk36_10>They fought alongside other species against the monsters sent by the evil god Kades...</ScenarioTalk36_10>
    <ScenarioTalk36_11>But... In regards to the Metal Tower and Elysium...</ScenarioTalk36_11>
    <ScenarioTalk36_12> I have no idea where they are located...</ScenarioTalk36_12>
    <ScenarioTalk36_13>- Anything else? -</ScenarioTalk36_13>
    <ScenarioTalk36_14>Ah! This might be helpful.</ScenarioTalk36_14>
    <ScenarioTalk36_15>- Yulia gave you an old vellum -</ScenarioTalk36_15>
    <ScenarioTalk36_16>This is a song written by the disciples of the Ancient Divine Dragon</ScenarioTalk36_16>
    <ScenarioTalk36_17> My guess is that there may be some clues here...</ScenarioTalk36_17>
    <ScenarioTalk36_18>- You thanked Yulia and put the vellum in the bag -</ScenarioTalk36_18>
    <ScenarioTalk36_19>- Let's ask around first... -</ScenarioTalk36_19>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk37_1>Huh? This is a very old book...</ScenarioTalk37_1>
    <ScenarioTalk37_2>I don't know how to read it... but I might be able to help you...</ScenarioTalk37_2>
    <ScenarioTalk37_3>- You asked Baruss to interpret the song -</ScenarioTalk37_3>
    <ScenarioTalk37_4>It's a type of song... The Ancient Divine Dragon was considered the first descendent of the Light...</ScenarioTalk37_4>
    <ScenarioTalk37_5>This song celebrates the Dragon... Give me a second!</ScenarioTalk37_5>
    <ScenarioTalk37_6>~ Mind of earth, smile of aqua, courage of fire, peace of wind will work together with the light... ~</ScenarioTalk37_6>
    <ScenarioTalk37_7>- Baruss hesitated and then put down the vellum -</ScenarioTalk37_7>
    <ScenarioTalk37_8>Sorry... That is all I can do... I don't understand the rest of the paragraph...</ScenarioTalk37_8>
    <ScenarioTalk37_9>- You heard someone singing in the background -</ScenarioTalk37_9>
    <ScenarioTalk37_10>Descendent of the Light....become the Light of the World~! Are you talking about this song?!</ScenarioTalk37_10>
    <ScenarioTalk37_11>- Baruss and I quickly turned toward the sound with surprised looks... -</ScenarioTalk37_11>
    <ScenarioTalk37_12>Stop staring at me! I am blushing...</ScenarioTalk37_12>
    <ScenarioTalk37_13>- You quickly grabbed Popo's shoulder! -</ScenarioTalk37_13>
    <ScenarioTalk37_14>What? Did I do something wrong? You are scaring me!!</ScenarioTalk37_14>
    <ScenarioTalk37_15>- That song...!! Who taught it to you?! -</ScenarioTalk37_15>
    <ScenarioTalk37_16>...What?</ScenarioTalk37_16>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk38_1>Why do you look so surprised?</ScenarioTalk38_1>
    <ScenarioTalk38_2>All kids from the Elpis neighborhood know this song...!!</ScenarioTalk38_2>
    <ScenarioTalk38_3>- You asked Popo to sing it once more -</ScenarioTalk38_3>
    <ScenarioTalk38_4>O-Oh... Okay!!</ScenarioTalk38_4>
    <ScenarioTalk38_5>~ Mind of earth, smile of aqua, courage of fire, peace of wind will work together with the Light... ~</ScenarioTalk38_5>
    <ScenarioTalk38_6>~ Descendent of the Light....become the Light of the World~!!</ScenarioTalk38_6>
    <ScenarioTalk38_7>- You wrote down the lyrics of the song -</ScenarioTalk38_7>
    <ScenarioTalk38_8>- Yulia will know more about this...! -</ScenarioTalk38_8>
    <ScenarioTalk38_9>What's going on? Why do you care so much about this song?</ScenarioTalk38_9>
    <ScenarioTalk38_10>- You say that you are looking for a clue from the past -</ScenarioTalk38_10>
    <ScenarioTalk38_11>Oh...?!</ScenarioTalk38_11>
    <ScenarioTalk38_12>- ? -</ScenarioTalk38_12>
    <ScenarioTalk38_13>I am glad to see you happy and excited about something!</ScenarioTalk38_13>
    <ScenarioTalk38_14>You looked lost for a while...</ScenarioTalk38_14>
    <ScenarioTalk38_15>- ....... -</ScenarioTalk38_15>
    <ScenarioTalk38_16>I am rooting for you! Cheer up!</ScenarioTalk38_16>
    <ScenarioTalk38_17>- You thanked Popo and left -</ScenarioTalk38_17>
    <ScenarioTalk38_18>- You are getting a grasp on this...! -</ScenarioTalk38_18>
    <ScenarioTalk38_19>- You will finally make it beyond the Barrier! To the Metal Tower and Elysium!! -</ScenarioTalk38_19>
    
    <ScenarioTalk38_20>- You heard someone running towards you. -</ScenarioTalk38_20>
    <ScenarioTalk38_21>Oh... I'm glad I caught up to you before you got too far.</ScenarioTalk38_21>
    <ScenarioTalk38_22>Popo! What's up?</ScenarioTalk38_22>
    <ScenarioTalk38_23>Hey... I did help you... in no small way, right?</ScenarioTalk38_23>
    <ScenarioTalk38_24>Umm... yes?</ScenarioTalk38_24>
    <ScenarioTalk38_25>Then of course, I can expect some help back, right?</ScenarioTalk38_25>
    <ScenarioTalk38_26>What...what?</ScenarioTalk38_26>
    <ScenarioTalk38_27>Hey... you're not those cheapskates that just takes from others and ignore the repaying... are you?</ScenarioTalk38_27>
    <ScenarioTalk38_28>- Before Popo asked you what you thought... he pointed towards the Waterfall of Ghosts. -</ScenarioTalk38_28>
    <ScenarioTalk38_29>The merchants that deliver to Elpis have been attacked recently by a monster!</ScenarioTalk38_29>
    <ScenarioTalk38_30>And the monster that is attacking the merchants is the leader of the Waterfall of Ghosts, Kadimorphs!</ScenarioTalk38_30>
    <ScenarioTalk38_31>And I'm sure you know what I'm about to say... right?</ScenarioTalk38_31>
    <ScenarioTalk38_32>You want me to beat some sense into Kadimorphs for the safety of the merchants, right?</ScenarioTalk38_32>
    <ScenarioTalk38_33>Genius! If you beat Kadimorphs about %1$s times, then I'm sure he won't even think about going near the merchants!</ScenarioTalk38_33>
    <ScenarioTalk38_34>- You accepted Popo's request and headed towards the Waterfall of Ghosts. -</ScenarioTalk38_34>
    <ScenarioTalk38_35>He was so bothersome. Well... I'm sure even Popo will be satisfied with this.</ScenarioTalk38_35>
    <ScenarioTalk38_36>Well... let's get going then. I don't think the merchants will ever be attacked again from that monster!</ScenarioTalk38_36>
    <ScenarioTalk38_37>- You agreed with Nuri and Jimon, and left the Waterfall of Ghosts. -</ScenarioTalk38_37>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk39_1>Haha... I can't believe that the clue was here all along!</ScenarioTalk39_1>
    <ScenarioTalk39_2>That song has to be a clue to find what we need!!</ScenarioTalk39_2>
    <ScenarioTalk39_3>- A clue? -</ScenarioTalk39_3>
    <ScenarioTalk39_4>The first verse of the song, “Mind of earth, smile of aqua, courage of fire, peace of wind”......</ScenarioTalk39_4>
    <ScenarioTalk39_5>must refer to the essences born out of the War of Light and Dark</ScenarioTalk39_5>
    <ScenarioTalk39_6>- 4 essences?...Earth/ Aqua/ Fire/ Wind...? -</ScenarioTalk39_6>
    <ScenarioTalk39_7>- Yulia nodded -</ScenarioTalk39_7>
    <ScenarioTalk39_8>But what does it mean, “they will work together”...?</ScenarioTalk39_8>
    <ScenarioTalk39_9>Huh? Have you been asking around for clues?</ScenarioTalk39_9>
    <ScenarioTalk39_10>Oh~ What have you found??</ScenarioTalk39_10>
    <ScenarioTalk39_11>- You told all the things you've found out so far to Nuri and Jimon. -</ScenarioTalk39_11>
    <ScenarioTalk39_12>That is an interesting phrase... The more I think about it, it sounds more complicated...</ScenarioTalk39_12>
    <ScenarioTalk39_13>No! What if...</ScenarioTalk39_13>
    <ScenarioTalk39_14>What?</ScenarioTalk39_14>
    <ScenarioTalk39_15>Why don't we interpret it literally? We are making things too complicated!!</ScenarioTalk39_15>
    <ScenarioTalk39_16>I am surprised to hear you say that. Haha!</ScenarioTalk39_16>
    <ScenarioTalk39_17>Anyway! I think Earth/Aqua/Fire/Wind refer to regions, Forest/Shipwreck/Fire Mountain/Wind Temple!!</ScenarioTalk39_17>
    <ScenarioTalk39_18>- Yulia started to talk while listening. -</ScenarioTalk39_18>
    <ScenarioTalk39_19>Maybe Nuri is right...!</ScenarioTalk39_19>
    <ScenarioTalk39_20>The Forest of Hope and the Shipwreck... the Fire Mountain and the Wind Temple...They all have ancient slates according to rumors!</ScenarioTalk39_20>
    <ScenarioTalk39_21>Slates?</ScenarioTalk39_21>
    <ScenarioTalk39_22>...Dragons should be able to find the slates and answer our questions!</ScenarioTalk39_22>
    <ScenarioTalk39_23>So...!!</ScenarioTalk39_23>
    <ScenarioTalk39_24>Basically, we have to go on an adventure to the Forest of Hope, the Shipwreck, the Fire Mountain and the Wind Temple with dragons to search for the slates!</ScenarioTalk39_24>
    <ScenarioTalk39_25>That was easy!</ScenarioTalk39_25>
    <ScenarioTalk39_26>The slates will have messages engraved on them... Please take notes and bring them back!</ScenarioTalk39_26>
    <ScenarioTalk39_27>I will try my best to decode the messages...</ScenarioTalk39_27>
    <ScenarioTalk39_28>This feels like the beginning of another great adventure!</ScenarioTalk39_28>
    <ScenarioTalk39_29>Let's go!!</ScenarioTalk39_29>
    <ScenarioTalk39_30>- You nodded and rushed out -</ScenarioTalk39_30>
    <ScenarioTalk39_31>- First destination! The Forest of Hope!! -</ScenarioTalk39_31>
    
    <ScenarioTalk39_32>Maybe we should do as Yulia said and search the vicinity of the Forest of Hope.</ScenarioTalk39_32>
    <ScenarioTalk39_33>Yes. We should look around the area, first. Since we don't have any information...</ScenarioTalk39_33>
    <ScenarioTalk39_34>First, Jimon and I will look around the Forest of Hope together.</ScenarioTalk39_34>
    <ScenarioTalk39_35>Let's split up and you search your own area. That will be more effective.</ScenarioTalk39_35>
    <ScenarioTalk39_36>Maybe we're wasting our time... but let's give it a shot.</ScenarioTalk39_36>
    <ScenarioTalk39_37>Hey... did you find anything out?</ScenarioTalk39_37>
    <ScenarioTalk39_38>- You tell them nothing yet. -</ScenarioTalk39_38>
    <ScenarioTalk39_39>Hmm... it seems like it will not be easy to find a clue.</ScenarioTalk39_39>
    <ScenarioTalk39_40>Let's search again... together this time. I still have a feeling that there's something here.</ScenarioTalk39_40>
    <ScenarioTalk39_41>How about going back? I think we need to take a rest.</ScenarioTalk39_41>
    <ScenarioTalk39_42>- You nod in agreement with Jimon, and left the Forest of Hope. -</ScenarioTalk39_42>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk40_1>Okay! Let's search for anything related to “mind of earth!</ScenarioTalk40_1>
    <ScenarioTalk40_2>Do you know what we are looking for?</ScenarioTalk40_2>
    <ScenarioTalk40_3>Sure!</ScenarioTalk40_3>
    <ScenarioTalk40_4>......</ScenarioTalk40_4>
    <ScenarioTalk40_5>Maybe...?</ScenarioTalk40_5>
    <ScenarioTalk40_6>Let's look for the slate first!</ScenarioTalk40_6>
    <ScenarioTalk40_7>According to Yulia... It should be somewhere around here!</ScenarioTalk40_7>
    <ScenarioTalk40_8>Yulia said we should use our dragons!</ScenarioTalk40_8>
    <ScenarioTalk40_9>Yeah! Let's use our dragons to look for the slate!!</ScenarioTalk40_9>
    <ScenarioTalk40_10>- You nodded -</ScenarioTalk40_10>
    <ScenarioTalk40_11>Huh?! The dragon is digging something over there!!</ScenarioTalk40_11>
    <ScenarioTalk40_12>Let's help out!!</ScenarioTalk40_12>
    <ScenarioTalk40_13>- After digging for a while, you came to a halt... Something big was buried underneath you -</ScenarioTalk40_13>
    <ScenarioTalk40_14>Aha! This must be a treasure chest!!</ScenarioTalk40_14>
    <ScenarioTalk40_15>Are you nuts...?!</ScenarioTalk40_15>
    <ScenarioTalk40_16>Since I am pretty, I will take 70%, and you can take the remaining 30%!</ScenarioTalk40_16>
    <ScenarioTalk40_17>Stop with your nonsense! Let's take it out!</ScenarioTalk40_17>
    <ScenarioTalk40_18>- Leaving behind Nuri's complaint, she pulled out something from the ground. -</ScenarioTalk40_18>
    <ScenarioTalk40_19>hmmm...! This is...</ScenarioTalk40_19>
    <ScenarioTalk40_20>...a slate! There is a message engraved on it...!!</ScenarioTalk40_20>
    <ScenarioTalk40_21>- A green slate... This must be rare in this area -</ScenarioTalk40_21>
    <ScenarioTalk40_22>- You wrote down the biggest characters on the slate -</ScenarioTalk40_22>
    <ScenarioTalk40_23>- The mind of earth is turquoise... -</ScenarioTalk40_23>
    <ScenarioTalk40_24>What does this mean? </ScenarioTalk40_24>
    <ScenarioTalk40_25>Just write it down!</ScenarioTalk40_25>
    <ScenarioTalk40_26>This is just the beginning... We need to find the remaining slates...!</ScenarioTalk40_26>
    <ScenarioTalk40_27>- You nodded and started looking for the other ones -</ScenarioTalk40_27>
    
    <ScenarioTalk40_28>Hey... where is Nuri? Wasn't she with you?</ScenarioTalk40_28>
    <ScenarioTalk40_29>- Speaking of which... Nuri has suddenly disappeared. Did she have an urgent business to take care of? -</ScenarioTalk40_29>
    <ScenarioTalk40_30>Oh, no! Come on! We've no time to lose!</ScenarioTalk40_30>
    <ScenarioTalk40_31>What's going on! Tell us what's going on!</ScenarioTalk40_31>
    <ScenarioTalk40_32>Massive number of monsters are gathered around the Shipwreck!</ScenarioTalk40_32>
    <ScenarioTalk40_33>What did you say?</ScenarioTalk40_33>
    <ScenarioTalk40_34>And they were headed towards Elpis! If we don't stop them... everyone in the village are in danger!</ScenarioTalk40_34>
    <ScenarioTalk40_35>They split up into two groups and in headed separate direction.</ScenarioTalk40_35>
    <ScenarioTalk40_36>If we split up and take one group each, then it will not be that difficult.</ScenarioTalk40_36>
    <ScenarioTalk40_37>We'll take care of the group headed towards Elpis. You handle the monsters near the Shipwreck.</ScenarioTalk40_37>
    <ScenarioTalk40_38>- You nodded in agreement and quickly rushed towards the Shipwreck. -</ScenarioTalk40_38>
    <ScenarioTalk40_39>Ouch... oweeee my head!</ScenarioTalk40_39>
    <ScenarioTalk40_40>I think we fought too hard. Anyway... how did it go at the Shipwreck?</ScenarioTalk40_40>
    <ScenarioTalk40_41>- You tell them that you got all the monsters. -</ScenarioTalk40_41>
    <ScenarioTalk40_42>Wow! There were more monsters on that side. You got them all by yourself? Amazing!</ScenarioTalk40_42>
    <ScenarioTalk40_43>Village guards and Kanggalo would normally take care of the monsters... I wonder where they are at.</ScenarioTalk40_43>
    <ScenarioTalk40_44>Ah... I asked about that when I was in the village. Kanggalo was out on a date.</ScenarioTalk40_44>
    <ScenarioTalk40_45>What the? He places higher priority over a girl than the safety of the village?</ScenarioTalk40_45>
    <ScenarioTalk40_46>Well... if you were in his shoes... than I'm sure you would understand.</ScenarioTalk40_46>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk41_1>Okay, let's use our dragons!</ScenarioTalk41_1>
    <ScenarioTalk41_2>Okay! I will take this side!!</ScenarioTalk41_2>
    <ScenarioTalk41_3>Where do you think you are going? That road leads to our village!!</ScenarioTalk41_3>
    <ScenarioTalk41_4>Honest mistake... haha!</ScenarioTalk41_4>
    <ScenarioTalk41_5>I will take Nuri and head that way! Why don't you head toward to ocean?</ScenarioTalk41_5>
    <ScenarioTalk41_6>- You nodded and made haste with your dragon -</ScenarioTalk41_6>
    <ScenarioTalk41_7>- Where is this Shipwreck? -</ScenarioTalk41_7>
    <ScenarioTalk41_8>- Your dragon jumped in and swam toward something -</ScenarioTalk41_8>
    <ScenarioTalk41_9>- And stopped at a certain point -</ScenarioTalk41_9>
    <ScenarioTalk41_10>- That must be it! -</ScenarioTalk41_10>
    <ScenarioTalk41_11>- A blue slate lay under the dragon -</ScenarioTalk41_11>
    <ScenarioTalk41_12>- The characters on the slate said "Blue"...That must mean something! -</ScenarioTalk41_12>
    <ScenarioTalk41_13>- You can see Nuri and Jimon searching in the distance -</ScenarioTalk41_13>
    <ScenarioTalk41_14>- They saw you and came over -</ScenarioTalk41_14>
    <ScenarioTalk41_15>Did you find anything?!</ScenarioTalk41_15>
    <ScenarioTalk41_16>You look like you are in a good mood~!</ScenarioTalk41_16>
    <ScenarioTalk41_17>- You nodded with a smile on your face -</ScenarioTalk41_17>
    <ScenarioTalk41_18>Awesome! Off to the Fire Mountain!!</ScenarioTalk41_18>
    <ScenarioTalk41_19>We are almost there!! </ScenarioTalk41_19>
    
    <ScenarioTalk41_20>Well... then all we need to do now is to go to the Fire Mountain and look for the Stone Tablet?</ScenarioTalk41_20>
    <ScenarioTalk41_21>As Yulia said, mysterious stone tablets were hidden in various regions.</ScenarioTalk41_21>
    <ScenarioTalk41_22>But what secret do the stone tablets possess?</ScenarioTalk41_22>
    <ScenarioTalk41_23>Hmm....</ScenarioTalk41_23>
    <ScenarioTalk41_24>Humph! You still look all confident!</ScenarioTalk41_24>
    <ScenarioTalk41_25>- Raon? -</ScenarioTalk41_25>
    <ScenarioTalk41_26>It seems like you're headed to the Fire Mountain. But that place is no place for rookies like you.</ScenarioTalk41_26>
    <ScenarioTalk41_27>What the? Were you following us all these time?</ScenarioTalk41_27>
    <ScenarioTalk41_28>He seems to have an unusual hobby.</ScenarioTalk41_28>
    <ScenarioTalk41_29>What did you say?</ScenarioTalk41_29>
    <ScenarioTalk41_30>- You asked Raon what he's doing here. -</ScenarioTalk41_30>
    <ScenarioTalk41_31>Ah, yes. I've heard that the leader in the Fire Mountain... the Fire Red Stone is attacking the tourists.</ScenarioTalk41_31>
    <ScenarioTalk41_32>I want to defeat him myself but... I need to go over to the Sky Temple.</ScenarioTalk41_32>
    <ScenarioTalk41_33>And wanted to ask you to eliminate that monster and help the people.</ScenarioTalk41_33>
    <ScenarioTalk41_34>- You smile and say OK. -</ScenarioTalk41_34>
    <ScenarioTalk41_35>Well, that's it. Got to go now. So long!</ScenarioTalk41_35>
    <ScenarioTalk41_36>Maybe he's not a bad person, after all.</ScenarioTalk41_36>
    <ScenarioTalk41_37>Yea... sometimes, it's those who don't express themselves well are really noble inside.</ScenarioTalk41_37>
    <ScenarioTalk41_38>- Nuri and Jimon started to talk about some strange stories. -</ScenarioTalk41_38>
    <ScenarioTalk41_39>Why do I get a feeling that we did a good deed... but also wasted our time.</ScenarioTalk41_39>
    <ScenarioTalk41_40>Yea... you area always busy... right?</ScenarioTalk41_40>
    <ScenarioTalk41_41>That wasn't meant to be a compliment, right?</ScenarioTalk41_41>
    <ScenarioTalk41_42>Wow! Did you guys defeat the Fire Red Stone?</ScenarioTalk41_42>
    <ScenarioTalk41_43>- Kanggalo? -</ScenarioTalk41_43>
    <ScenarioTalk41_44>I was planning to kill it... but I fell on the way and just got here now.</ScenarioTalk41_44>
    <ScenarioTalk41_45>I was worried about the troubles that Fire Red Stone was causing... thanks!</ScenarioTalk41_45>
    <ScenarioTalk41_46>But I thought only I knew about this problem. How did you know?</ScenarioTalk41_46>
    <ScenarioTalk41_47>- Then did Raon came all the way up here to tell us to help the people? -</ScenarioTalk41_47>
    <ScenarioTalk41_48>- You should say thanks the next time you meet him. -</ScenarioTalk41_48>
    <ScenarioTalk41_49>By the way... Kanggalo!</ScenarioTalk41_49>
    <ScenarioTalk41_50>Yes?</ScenarioTalk41_50>
    <ScenarioTalk41_51>How was the date?</ScenarioTalk41_51>
    <ScenarioTalk41_52>Hush!</ScenarioTalk41_52>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk42_1>Is this where the third slate is located?!</ScenarioTalk42_1>
    <ScenarioTalk42_2>It's dangerous! Take your time!!</ScenarioTalk42_2>
    <ScenarioTalk42_3>Hmmm... Let's go a little further!</ScenarioTalk42_3>
    <ScenarioTalk42_4>No, it is too dangerous! The volcano can erupt at any moment!!</ScenarioTalk42_4>
    <ScenarioTalk42_5>But... We've looked everywhere!</ScenarioTalk42_5>
    <ScenarioTalk42_6>Hmmm...What do you think?!</ScenarioTalk42_6>
    <ScenarioTalk42_7>- You told Nuri and Jimon that you would search inside of the volcano by yourself -</ScenarioTalk42_7>
    <ScenarioTalk42_8>I like your attitude!! I will check out the other side!</ScenarioTalk42_8>
    <ScenarioTalk42_9>Don't kill yourself over this!</ScenarioTalk42_9>
    <ScenarioTalk42_10>- You replied and went inside the volcano -</ScenarioTalk42_10>
    <ScenarioTalk42_11>- After a while, something unusual caught your eyes...!-</ScenarioTalk42_11>
    <ScenarioTalk42_12>- A small red slate... That must be it! -</ScenarioTalk42_12>
    <ScenarioTalk42_13>- !!! -</ScenarioTalk42_13>
    <ScenarioTalk42_14>What... what!</ScenarioTalk42_14>
    <ScenarioTalk42_15>Ahhh!! I told you! The volcano erupted!! Run!!!</ScenarioTalk42_15>
    <ScenarioTalk42_16>Just give me a second...!</ScenarioTalk42_16>
    <ScenarioTalk42_17>What are you doing? You idiot! Do you want to die here?</ScenarioTalk42_17>
    <ScenarioTalk42_18>- You haven't read the words yet! You need more time!!! -</ScenarioTalk42_18>
    <ScenarioTalk42_19>- You wrote down the words as lava was flowing everywhere -</ScenarioTalk42_19>
    <ScenarioTalk42_20>- The words on the slate said “Blazing Fire”!! -</ScenarioTalk42_20>
    <ScenarioTalk42_21>- As you were leaving, a loud explosion knocked you out... -</ScenarioTalk42_21>
    <ScenarioTalk42_22>Wake up!</ScenarioTalk42_22>
    <ScenarioTalk42_23>He is still alive... Tenacious fool...! I can't believe he wrote down the words in that chaos...!!</ScenarioTalk42_23>
    <ScenarioTalk42_24>He is lucky to be alive...!</ScenarioTalk42_24>
    <ScenarioTalk42_25>Don't do that again!!</ScenarioTalk42_25>
    <ScenarioTalk42_26>- You nodded as you slowly got up -</ScenarioTalk42_26>
    <ScenarioTalk42_27>...So... What did it say?</ScenarioTalk42_27>
    <ScenarioTalk42_28>- “Blazing Fire” -</ScenarioTalk42_28>
    <ScenarioTalk42_29>Three down... one to go! We are so close to finishing it!!</ScenarioTalk42_29>
    <ScenarioTalk42_30>Okay! Let's go to the Wind Temple!!!</ScenarioTalk42_30>
    
    <ScenarioTalk42_31>I have a feeling that we won't find stone tablet easily at the Wind Temple.</ScenarioTalk42_31>
    <ScenarioTalk42_32>Hmmm... this thing about getting more difficult as we progress... it's in a way exciting but also bothering.</ScenarioTalk42_32>
    <ScenarioTalk42_33>What are you talking about?</ScenarioTalk42_33>
    <ScenarioTalk42_34>I'm talking about what you're thinking about....</ScenarioTalk42_34>
    <ScenarioTalk42_35>You're hungry also?</ScenarioTalk42_35>
    <ScenarioTalk42_36>.......</ScenarioTalk42_36>
    <ScenarioTalk42_37>I came because I was worried... and it seems like my concern is proven correct.</ScenarioTalk42_37>
    <ScenarioTalk42_38>- Yulia? -</ScenarioTalk42_38>
    <ScenarioTalk42_39>The 4 stone tablets are valuable relics that belonged to the Apostles of Light. So of course... they will not be easy to find.</ScenarioTalk42_39>
    <ScenarioTalk42_40>There's a limit on relying on the dragon.</ScenarioTalk42_40>
    <ScenarioTalk42_41>Well... then is there easier way to find the tablets?</ScenarioTalk42_41>
    <ScenarioTalk42_42>Ah... there is, actually!</ScenarioTalk42_42>
    <ScenarioTalk42_43>Well, alright!</ScenarioTalk42_43>
    <ScenarioTalk42_44>Easier way to find the stone tablets?</ScenarioTalk42_44>
    <ScenarioTalk42_45>As you may already know, there's a magic stone hidden inside the Wind Temple.</ScenarioTalk42_45>
    <ScenarioTalk42_46>If you use this magic stone on your dragon, its senses are amplified and it will be able to find the stone tablets more easily.</ScenarioTalk42_46>
    <ScenarioTalk42_47>Alright! Let's get going!</ScenarioTalk42_47>
    <ScenarioTalk42_48>Let's split up. Let's go!</ScenarioTalk42_48>
    <ScenarioTalk42_49>- You thank Yulia and quickly rushed towards the Wind Temple. -</ScenarioTalk42_49>
    <ScenarioTalk42_50>- As Yulia said, you got the magic stone. Let's use it on your dragon. -</ScenarioTalk42_50>
    <ScenarioTalk42_51>- There's a sudden spark and the dragon's senses seem to be more sensitive than before. -</ScenarioTalk42_51>
    <ScenarioTalk42_52>- Maybe it also affected you. It seems like you have become more sensitive as well. -</ScenarioTalk42_52>
    <ScenarioTalk42_53>- Let's meet up with Nuri and Jimon before it's too late. -</ScenarioTalk42_53>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk43_1>Ugh! This place is spooky!!</ScenarioTalk43_1>
    <ScenarioTalk43_2>It's just in your head! Haha. I don't feel anything~! </ScenarioTalk43_2>
    <ScenarioTalk43_3>Whatever!!</ScenarioTalk43_3>
    <ScenarioTalk43_4>Let's split up and look for the last slate! It will be more effective this way... Don't you think?!</ScenarioTalk43_4>
    <ScenarioTalk43_5>Sure! Jimon and I will search this area!</ScenarioTalk43_5>
    <ScenarioTalk43_6>Then... Which side do you want?</ScenarioTalk43_6>
    <ScenarioTalk43_7>- You said that you will search the premises -</ScenarioTalk43_7>
    <ScenarioTalk43_8>You are so reliable ~ My type of guy~!</ScenarioTalk43_8>
    <ScenarioTalk43_9>The words that every guy wants to hear!</ScenarioTalk43_9>
    <ScenarioTalk43_10>What?!</ScenarioTalk43_10>
    <ScenarioTalk43_11>Catch me if you can. Hahaha!</ScenarioTalk43_11>
    <ScenarioTalk43_12>Stop!!!</ScenarioTalk43_12>
    <ScenarioTalk43_13>- Nuri and Jimon headed south... Okay...! Let the search begin~! -</ScenarioTalk43_13>
    <ScenarioTalk43_14>- There is nothing in the vicinity... Let's expand the search area -</ScenarioTalk43_14>
    <ScenarioTalk43_15>- Was this a waste of time?...You can't find anything unusual... -</ScenarioTalk43_15>
    <ScenarioTalk43_16>- You are far away from where you started... you should head back before you get lost... Huh?! -</ScenarioTalk43_16>
    <ScenarioTalk43_17>- A small blue slate is stuck on a rock in the corner! -</ScenarioTalk43_17>
    <ScenarioTalk43_18>- Found it! -</ScenarioTalk43_18>
    <ScenarioTalk43_19>- You happily wrote down the word -</ScenarioTalk43_19>
    <ScenarioTalk43_20>- Silence -</ScenarioTalk43_20>
    <ScenarioTalk43_21>- You finally have all four words! You should head back to Yulia... and.......Huh!!? -</ScenarioTalk43_21>
    <ScenarioTalk43_22>- Did you stray too far away from the starting point? -</ScenarioTalk43_22>
    <ScenarioTalk43_23>- Severe wind pushed you back! -</ScenarioTalk43_23>
    <ScenarioTalk43_24>- Pull yourself together!! If you take a single wrong step, you could be in a lot of trouble... Aaaaahhhhhh!!! -</ScenarioTalk43_24>
    <ScenarioTalk43_25>- You must have injured my head... -</ScenarioTalk43_25>
    <ScenarioTalk43_26>- You are still a little disoriented... Ha... you must be lucky... to have survived the steep drop.... -</ScenarioTalk43_26>
    <ScenarioTalk43_27>- But how can you climb back up with your injured legs...? Hmmmm -</ScenarioTalk43_27>
    <ScenarioTalk43_28>- The Ancient...Divine...Dragon!? -</ScenarioTalk43_28>
    <ScenarioTalk43_29>Are you OK?!!</ScenarioTalk43_29>
    <ScenarioTalk43_30>Why does he pass out everywhere!! Wake up!!!</ScenarioTalk43_30>
    <ScenarioTalk43_31>How can you say it like that?</ScenarioTalk43_31>
    <ScenarioTalk43_32>Just kidding! Anyway, are you okay?!</ScenarioTalk43_32>
    <ScenarioTalk43_33>- You don't seem to be critically injured... you slowly got up while smiling awkwardly at Nuri and Jimon -</ScenarioTalk43_33>
    <ScenarioTalk43_34>- You lost my balance and fell once again because of injured leg -</ScenarioTalk43_34>
    <ScenarioTalk43_35>Ah! Let me help you!</ScenarioTalk43_35>
    <ScenarioTalk43_36>This looks pretty bad... Let's head back to town.</ScenarioTalk43_36>
    <ScenarioTalk43_37>- You showed the last word, "Silence" to Jimon -</ScenarioTalk43_37>
    <ScenarioTalk43_38>...You surprise me every day...! I have never seen a Dragon Tamer like you!!</ScenarioTalk43_38>
    <ScenarioTalk43_39>Ah...! It's a compliment! I am serious!!!</ScenarioTalk43_39>
    <ScenarioTalk43_40>Anyway! I am glad you are okay!!</ScenarioTalk43_40>
    <ScenarioTalk43_41> Now that we have all four words, let's get you cleaned up and talk to Yulia!</ScenarioTalk43_41>
    <ScenarioTalk43_42>Yes... We can finally solve this mystery!</ScenarioTalk43_42>
    
    <ScenarioTalk43_43>Great! Just one stone tablet left.</ScenarioTalk43_43>
    <ScenarioTalk43_44>Let's not let our guards down. Who knows what's waiting for us.</ScenarioTalk43_44>
    <ScenarioTalk43_45>Well... you're right. We shouldn't get all excited, just yet.</ScenarioTalk43_45>
    <ScenarioTalk43_46>Here you are! I was looking all over for you.</ScenarioTalk43_46>
    <ScenarioTalk43_47>- Randolph? -</ScenarioTalk43_47>
    <ScenarioTalk43_48>I really need your help! Can you help me, please?</ScenarioTalk43_48>
    <ScenarioTalk43_49>We're quite busy at the moment.</ScenarioTalk43_49>
    <ScenarioTalk43_50>We're on a very important mission.</ScenarioTalk43_50>
    <ScenarioTalk43_51>Humph. In case you forgot! A hero must help the innocent and helpless!</ScenarioTalk43_51>
    <ScenarioTalk43_52>If you don't help me, I'll spread terrible rumors in the village.</ScenarioTalk43_52>
    <ScenarioTalk43_53>Hey... that's not funny!</ScenarioTalk43_53>
    <ScenarioTalk43_54>Well... I was half joking. The Gold Titan in the Wind Temple is really bothering my research.</ScenarioTalk43_54>
    <ScenarioTalk43_55>Wait... let me guess!</ScenarioTalk43_55>
    <ScenarioTalk43_56>Yea... I need you guys to go and eliminate %1$s Gold Titans!</ScenarioTalk43_56>
    <ScenarioTalk43_57>Is this the side effects of being famous?</ScenarioTalk43_57>
    <ScenarioTalk43_58>- You say alright to Randolph. -</ScenarioTalk43_58>
    <ScenarioTalk43_59>Thanks. I'll be waiting for good news, Mr. Hero.</ScenarioTalk43_59>
    <ScenarioTalk43_60>Don't worry any more since the Gold Titans are gone.</ScenarioTalk43_60>
    <ScenarioTalk43_61>Wow~ truly amazing!</ScenarioTalk43_61>
    <ScenarioTalk43_62>Well, I've got nothing to give you... but I'll always be grateful.</ScenarioTalk43_62>
    <ScenarioTalk43_63>Oh, ho! Shall I continue with my research now? Oh, ho, ho!</ScenarioTalk43_63>
    <ScenarioTalk43_64>Well... if we keep on doing good deeds like this... maybe something good will happen to us, someday.</ScenarioTalk43_64>
    <ScenarioTalk43_65>Hmm... do you really think so?</ScenarioTalk43_65>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk44_1>Mind of earth is turquoise, smile of aqua is blue, courage of fire is blazing flame, and peace of wind is silence...</ScenarioTalk44_1>
    <ScenarioTalk44_2>I wish...</ScenarioTalk44_2>
    <ScenarioTalk44_3>My descendent to become the Light of the world....</ScenarioTalk44_3>
    <ScenarioTalk44_4>Turquoise, blue, blazing flame, and silence... These words remind me of the four essences.</ScenarioTalk44_4>
    <ScenarioTalk44_5>Does this remind you of anything...?</ScenarioTalk44_5>
    <ScenarioTalk44_6>...Using the disciple's inscription, this is my interpretation for each word ...</ScenarioTalk44_6>
    <ScenarioTalk44_7>Glory to the first descendent of the Light...</ScenarioTalk44_7>
    <ScenarioTalk44_8>The first descendent... That must be...!</ScenarioTalk44_8>
    <ScenarioTalk44_9>The Ancient Divine Dragon... the first descendent of Amorru, God of Light and Creation!</ScenarioTalk44_9>
    <ScenarioTalk44_10>So... What can we do with this word!?!</ScenarioTalk44_10>
    <ScenarioTalk44_11>My guess is that... If you scream this phrase at the highest point of the Sky Temple...!</ScenarioTalk44_11>
    <ScenarioTalk44_12>Something will appear...</ScenarioTalk44_12>
    <ScenarioTalk44_13>There will be something that will guide us to places beyond the Barrier!</ScenarioTalk44_13>
    <ScenarioTalk44_14>The Tower of Light?</ScenarioTalk44_14>
    <ScenarioTalk44_15>Something that will lead us beyond the Barrier...</ScenarioTalk44_15>
    <ScenarioTalk44_16>- You thanked Yulia and headed out -</ScenarioTalk44_16>

    <ScenarioTalk44_17>Great! Now all we need to do is just go over to the Sky Temple and shout.</ScenarioTalk44_17>
    <ScenarioTalk44_18>Blessing to the 1st Descendant of Light! Is that it?</ScenarioTalk44_18>
    <ScenarioTalk44_19>Now we can find the hidden treasure of the Apostle of Light.</ScenarioTalk44_19>
    <ScenarioTalk44_20>And we will also find something that can take us to the other side of the Barrier.</ScenarioTalk44_20>
    <ScenarioTalk44_21>Ah... there's something I forgot. That's why I'm back.</ScenarioTalk44_21>
    <ScenarioTalk44_22>Yulia? What is it that you forgot to tell us?</ScenarioTalk44_22>
    <ScenarioTalk44_23>Unlike the past, the Sky Temple and its vicinity is currently occupied by numerous monsters.</ScenarioTalk44_23>
    <ScenarioTalk44_24>If you recite that spell without purifying the area first, there's a high chance that it may not work.</ScenarioTalk44_24>
    <ScenarioTalk44_25>.......</ScenarioTalk44_25>
    <ScenarioTalk44_26>- You asked Yulia about how to purify the area. -</ScenarioTalk44_26>
    <ScenarioTalk44_27>It may be impossible to get rid of all the monsters, but if you do eliminate some, then your chance for success will significantly increase.</ScenarioTalk44_27>
    <ScenarioTalk44_28>It may take some time... but it is very important that you eliminate as many monsters around the Sky Temple as possible.</ScenarioTalk44_28>
    <ScenarioTalk44_29>Yes, it is cumbersome but like Yulia said. It must be done.</ScenarioTalk44_29>
    <ScenarioTalk44_30>I will help you, together with Jimon. I'm sure we can finish quickly if we combine our strengths.</ScenarioTalk44_30>
    <ScenarioTalk44_31>- You agreed with Nuri and Jimon to purify the Sky Temple as quickly as possible. -</ScenarioTalk44_31>
    <ScenarioTalk44_32>...Yulia was correct. I never imagined that there would be this many monsters here.</ScenarioTalk44_32>
    <ScenarioTalk44_33>If we just came up here without knowing this... maybe the monsters would have gotten to us.</ScenarioTalk44_33>
    <ScenarioTalk44_34>Now that we got this many, I don't think we will be disturbed while shouting the spell.</ScenarioTalk44_34>
    <ScenarioTalk44_35>Well... let's go. There's only one thing left to do, now!</ScenarioTalk44_35>
    <ScenarioTalk44_36>Let's go to the place filled with the secrets of the Apostles of the Light... the Tower of Light!</ScenarioTalk44_36>
    <ScenarioTalk44_37>- Nuri and Jimon ran in front. What adventure can it be that awaits? -</ScenarioTalk44_37>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk45_1>The Sky Temple...The highest point...</ScenarioTalk45_1>
    <ScenarioTalk45_2>Can this be on top of the statue of the Ancient Dragon?!</ScenarioTalk45_2>
    <ScenarioTalk45_3>Jimon, you are a genius!!</ScenarioTalk45_3>
    <ScenarioTalk45_4>Stop it...!! You are making me self-conscious with your compliments...</ScenarioTalk45_4>
    <ScenarioTalk45_5>I mean... if this doesn't work out, it's not my fault. Haha!</ScenarioTalk45_5>
    <ScenarioTalk45_6>...... </ScenarioTalk45_6>
    <ScenarioTalk45_7>Let's go to the statue!</ScenarioTalk45_7>
    <ScenarioTalk45_8>- You nodded -</ScenarioTalk45_8>
    <ScenarioTalk45_9>How about shouting from here?</ScenarioTalk45_9>
    <ScenarioTalk45_10>Go ahead!!</ScenarioTalk45_10>
    <ScenarioTalk45_11>- A blessing to the First Descendent of the Light!! -</ScenarioTalk45_11>
    <ScenarioTalk45_12>Hmmm...! Nothing happened!!</ScenarioTalk45_12>
    <ScenarioTalk45_13>Why... Did Yulia give us wrong information ...?!</ScenarioTalk45_13>
    <ScenarioTalk45_14>Hey... Look over there!! What is that?!</ScenarioTalk45_14>
    <ScenarioTalk45_15>Hurry up!!!</ScenarioTalk45_15>
    <ScenarioTalk45_16>- You quickly moved toward Nuri and Jimon -</ScenarioTalk45_16>
    <ScenarioTalk45_17>That... That is...!</ScenarioTalk45_17>
    <ScenarioTalk45_18>That must be it! The Tower of Light!!! We did it!!!</ScenarioTalk45_18>
    <ScenarioTalk45_19>- A gigantic white tower appeared in front of us -</ScenarioTalk45_19>
    <ScenarioTalk45_20>- That must be the legendary Tower of Light -</ScenarioTalk45_20>
    <ScenarioTalk45_21>- You pulled yourself together and calmed your nerves -</ScenarioTalk45_21>
    <ScenarioTalk45_22>- No one has seen the Tower of Light -</ScenarioTalk45_22>
    <ScenarioTalk45_23>- Off to a place filled with secrets and danger...! -</ScenarioTalk45_23>
    
    <ScenarioTalk46_1>Wow... This is amazing!!!!</ScenarioTalk46_1>
    <ScenarioTalk46_2>OMG. The entire building is white!!</ScenarioTalk46_2>
    <ScenarioTalk46_3>This place is overwhelming...!!</ScenarioTalk46_3>
    <ScenarioTalk46_4>Yes! The mysterious atmosphere is scaring me little bit...</ScenarioTalk46_4>
    <ScenarioTalk46_5>Huh... Something is approaching us.</ScenarioTalk46_5>
    <ScenarioTalk46_6>Protect the Tower of Light....Protect the Tower from strangers...</ScenarioTalk46_6>
    <ScenarioTalk46_7>- Stone Keepers, guardians of the tower, appeared!! -</ScenarioTalk46_7>
    <ScenarioTalk46_8>Hold on..! We are just visiting!</ScenarioTalk46_8>
    <ScenarioTalk46_9>Look at my gorgeous face... You can let us through, right?</ScenarioTalk46_9>
    <ScenarioTalk46_10>Harmful creatures!!!</ScenarioTalk46_10>
    <ScenarioTalk46_11>- ...You must've provoked him -</ScenarioTalk46_11>
    <ScenarioTalk46_12>Wait! That is rude!! I am very attractive!!</ScenarioTalk46_12>
    <ScenarioTalk46_13>Uuuhhehehehe!!!</ScenarioTalk46_13>
    <ScenarioTalk46_14>Run, Nuri! Logic doesn't work on these guys!!</ScenarioTalk46_14>
    <ScenarioTalk46_15>He must've mistaken us for intruders!!</ScenarioTalk46_15>
    <ScenarioTalk46_16>A blessing to the First Descendent of the Light!!!</ScenarioTalk46_16>
    <ScenarioTalk46_17>Aaahh!!</ScenarioTalk46_17>
    <ScenarioTalk46_18>Help!!!</ScenarioTalk46_18>
    <ScenarioTalk46_19>- Nuri and Jimon quickly ran back to the other side in a matter of seconds -</ScenarioTalk46_19>
    <ScenarioTalk46_20>- The Stone Keeper must've followed them as well... -</ScenarioTalk46_20>
    <ScenarioTalk46_21>- Nuri and Jimon will probably get away safely, right? -</ScenarioTalk46_21>
    <ScenarioTalk46_22>- ...Let's head over this way! -</ScenarioTalk46_22>
    <ScenarioTalk46_23>- You carefully surveyed the area and moved with caution... -</ScenarioTalk46_23>
    <ScenarioTalk46_24>- It was inscribed with mysterious symbols and images. -</ScenarioTalk46_24>
    <ScenarioTalk46_25>- The place seemed untouched by visitors... -</ScenarioTalk46_25>
    <ScenarioTalk46_26>- Okay... Let's head upstairs! -</ScenarioTalk46_26>
    <ScenarioTalk46_27>- This place of sanctity....is filled with a void... It feels strange... -</ScenarioTalk46_27>
    <ScenarioTalk46_28>- ?! -</ScenarioTalk46_28>
    <ScenarioTalk46_29>- You hid behind the wall upon hearing footsteps -</ScenarioTalk46_29>
    <ScenarioTalk46_30>Intruders!</ScenarioTalk46_30>
    <ScenarioTalk46_31>Kill them!</ScenarioTalk46_31>
    <ScenarioTalk46_32>Downstairs!</ScenarioTalk46_32>
    <ScenarioTalk46_33>Kill them!</ScenarioTalk46_33>
    <ScenarioTalk46_34>- All floors were crowded with guardian Stone Keepers... -</ScenarioTalk46_34>
    <ScenarioTalk46_35>- You wondered if Nuri and Jimon were able to get away safely -</ScenarioTalk46_35>
    <ScenarioTalk46_36>- They will be fine... -</ScenarioTalk46_36>
    <ScenarioTalk46_37>- You moved swiftly once the Stone Keepers disappeared -</ScenarioTalk46_37>
    <ScenarioTalk46_38>-There is a stairway -</ScenarioTalk46_38>
    <ScenarioTalk46_39>- The amount of security only got worse as you climbed up to higher floors... Will you make it to the top? -</ScenarioTalk46_39>
    <ScenarioTalk46_40>- ...What is on the top floor? -</ScenarioTalk46_40>
    <ScenarioTalk46_41>- You decided to stop feeding my curiosity and focused on the adventure at hand -</ScenarioTalk46_41>
    <ScenarioTalk46_42>- The place still felt strange even after a while-</ScenarioTalk46_42>
    <ScenarioTalk46_43>- !!!!!!!!!??? -</ScenarioTalk46_43>
    <ScenarioTalk46_44>Hey! You scared me!!</ScenarioTalk46_44>
    <ScenarioTalk46_45>You must have gone through hell!!</ScenarioTalk46_45>
    <ScenarioTalk46_46>- You asked them how they made it upstairs -</ScenarioTalk46_46>
    <ScenarioTalk46_47>We ran away from Stone Keepers.</ScenarioTalk46_47>
    <ScenarioTalk46_48>Got trapped... but then safely escaped!!</ScenarioTalk46_48>
    <ScenarioTalk46_49>But a couple of Stone Keepers appeared out of nowhere...</ScenarioTalk46_49>
    <ScenarioTalk46_50>They ended up fighting each other while trying to catch us!!</ScenarioTalk46_50>
    <ScenarioTalk46_51>When we were surrounded by the scary Stone Keepers...</ScenarioTalk46_51>
    <ScenarioTalk46_52>I thought that was the end... I was preparing myself to face our fate!!</ScenarioTalk46_52>
    <ScenarioTalk46_53>..........</ScenarioTalk46_53>
    <ScenarioTalk46_54>Luckily, some stones fell down on them...!</ScenarioTalk46_54>
    <ScenarioTalk46_55>- Hmmm... So basically you ran away the entire time without fighting them....and won... Interesting...! -</ScenarioTalk46_55>
    <ScenarioTalk46_56>- ...In a way, that is quite impressive -</ScenarioTalk46_56>
    <ScenarioTalk46_57>Anyway....I think we are on the top floor... Do you guys see anything unusual?</ScenarioTalk46_57>
    <ScenarioTalk46_58>Nope! According to Yulia...</ScenarioTalk46_58>
    <ScenarioTalk46_59>There should be treasures or Disciples of the Light somewhere... Hmmm...</ScenarioTalk46_59>
    <ScenarioTalk46_60>- You should look around for any clues... -</ScenarioTalk46_60>
    <ScenarioTalk46_61>- You recommended that everyone look around one last time -</ScenarioTalk46_61>
    <ScenarioTalk46_62>Okay! I am going this way!!</ScenarioTalk46_62>
    <ScenarioTalk46_63>Well, then I'll go also to prevent Nuri from escaping!</ScenarioTalk46_63>
    <ScenarioTalk46_64>...........</ScenarioTalk46_64>
    <ScenarioTalk46_65>See you later! Let us know if you find anything!!</ScenarioTalk46_65>
    <ScenarioTalk46_66>- You nodded and continued scouting out the place... -</ScenarioTalk46_66>
    <ScenarioTalk46_67>- All of the floors looked exactly the same, with nothing but white pillars-</ScenarioTalk46_67>
    <ScenarioTalk46_68>- There is nothing unusual on this floor... -</ScenarioTalk46_68>
    <ScenarioTalk46_69>- You might be hallucinating... but the place seems to be growing brighter -</ScenarioTalk46_69>
    <ScenarioTalk46_70>- You think something is wrong. You have a bad feeling about this!! -</ScenarioTalk46_70>
    <ScenarioTalk46_71>- Where are Nuri and Jimon?!! -</ScenarioTalk46_71>
    <ScenarioTalk46_72>#$%#$%!!!</ScenarioTalk46_72>
    <ScenarioTalk46_73>#$%#@!!!!!</ScenarioTalk46_73>
    <ScenarioTalk46_74>- You couldn't hear what they were saying...-and then a light flashed in front of your eyes</ScenarioTalk46_74>
    <ScenarioTalk46_75>- When the light disappeared, you found yourself in an unknown place -</ScenarioTalk46_75>
    <ScenarioTalk46_76>- This place is..? -</ScenarioTalk46_76>
    <ScenarioTalk46_77>- !!!!!! -</ScenarioTalk46_77>
    <ScenarioTalk46_78>- A cliff... Are you at the top of the tower?!! -</ScenarioTalk46_78>
    <ScenarioTalk46_79>Intruder! Intruder!</ScenarioTalk46_79>
    <ScenarioTalk46_80>- What is that?! -</ScenarioTalk46_80>
    <ScenarioTalk46_81>Kill them! Kill them!</ScenarioTalk46_81>
    
    
    <!-- 라이트오브 전투 패배시   -->
    <ScenarioTalk1046_1>- He is too strong... But you need to know the secret!! -</ScenarioTalk1046_1>
    <ScenarioTalk1046_2>- You must beat him and find out what lies behind him!! -</ScenarioTalk1046_2>
    <ScenarioTalk1046_3>Kill him! Kill him!</ScenarioTalk1046_3>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk46_82>Critically damaged... Unable to operate... System... shut down.....</ScenarioTalk46_82>
    <ScenarioTalk46_83>- The Light Orb, the guardian of the tower, shut his systems down and went silent -</ScenarioTalk46_83>
    <ScenarioTalk46_84>- Simultaneously, a white light surrounded the entire tower -</ScenarioTalk46_84>
    <ScenarioTalk46_85>- After a flash, a mysterious bird appeared in front of you. -</ScenarioTalk46_85>
    <ScenarioTalk46_86>- With a noble posture and golden feathers.... -</ScenarioTalk46_86>
    <ScenarioTalk46_87>- Huge wings and sharp beak that could scare away the darkness -</ScenarioTalk46_87>
    <ScenarioTalk46_88>I hadn't realized that a person with strong light still existed... This is quite surprising!</ScenarioTalk46_88>
    <ScenarioTalk46_89>My name is Aeuros, the messenger of the God of Fate. I have been waiting for a suitable pilgrim until now.</ScenarioTalk46_89>
    <ScenarioTalk46_90>- Pilgrim of Light...? -</ScenarioTalk46_90>
    <ScenarioTalk46_91>A person who is worthy of carrying out the work of the Disciples...</ScenarioTalk46_91>
    <ScenarioTalk46_92>Presence of strong light....This is your alias.</ScenarioTalk46_92>
    <ScenarioTalk46_93>- What does that mean?! -</ScenarioTalk46_93>
    <ScenarioTalk46_94>Disciples of the Light carry out their missions and protect the records from evil monsters.</ScenarioTalk46_94>
    <ScenarioTalk46_95>By appointing the Light Orb, the Guardian of Light, to protect the tower</ScenarioTalk46_95>
    <ScenarioTalk46_96>You have proven your worthiness as a Pilgrim of Light through various tests...</ScenarioTalk46_96>
    <ScenarioTalk46_97>From now on, I will be your wings, and follow your command.</ScenarioTalk46_97>
    <ScenarioTalk46_98>- A sudden burst of white light overwhelmed me -</ScenarioTalk46_98>
    <ScenarioTalk46_99>- With my vision starting to fade, you can hear Aeuros's voice again. -</ScenarioTalk46_99>
    <ScenarioTalk46_100>Pilgrim of Light... the chosen one...</ScenarioTalk46_100>
    
    <ScenarioTalk46_101>Are you okay?</ScenarioTalk46_101>
    <ScenarioTalk46_102>A mysterious light surrounded us....by the time I found you, you were passed out on the floor.</ScenarioTalk46_102>
    <ScenarioTalk46_103>Strangely, those persistent gatekeepers were nowhere to be found on our way back...</ScenarioTalk46_103>
    <ScenarioTalk46_104>As if they were hiding from us...</ScenarioTalk46_104>
    <ScenarioTalk46_105>By the way, I saw an odd creature after you passed out in the tower!</ScenarioTalk46_105>
    <ScenarioTalk46_106>- An odd creature...? -</ScenarioTalk46_106>
    <ScenarioTalk46_107>- Nuri and Jimon explained -</ScenarioTalk46_107>
    <ScenarioTalk46_108>Ummm! I don't know how to describe it!</ScenarioTalk46_108>
    <ScenarioTalk46_109>A giant, frightening eagle...?</ScenarioTalk46_109>
    <ScenarioTalk46_110>No, that wasn't an eagle... It was bigger than a mountain!</ScenarioTalk46_110>
    
    <ScenarioTalk46_111>Yes! It was something out of this world!</ScenarioTalk46_111>
    <ScenarioTalk46_112>My guess is... a new monster...but...</ScenarioTalk46_112>
    <ScenarioTalk46_113>It didn't move even when we rescued you.</ScenarioTalk46_113>
    <ScenarioTalk46_114>His eyes were more friendly than hostile...</ScenarioTalk46_114>
    <ScenarioTalk46_115>This is just my guess... But that must've had everything to do with my charming looks.</ScenarioTalk46_115>
    <ScenarioTalk46_116>Ahh! ...My beauty has no limit!!</ScenarioTalk46_116>
    <ScenarioTalk46_117>- ....... -</ScenarioTalk46_117>
    <ScenarioTalk46_118>.......</ScenarioTalk46_118>
    <ScenarioTalk46_119>...Why are you looking at me like that?</ScenarioTalk46_119>
    <ScenarioTalk46_120>My God... I can't believe you actually met Aeuros!</ScenarioTalk46_120>
    
    <ScenarioTalk46_121>- Yulia approached you as if she knew the whole story -</ScenarioTalk46_121>
    <ScenarioTalk46_122>Huh... What? Aeuros?! Who are you talking about?...</ScenarioTalk46_122>
    <ScenarioTalk46_123>He was passed out on the floor by the time we found him.</ScenarioTalk46_123>
    <ScenarioTalk46_124>Are you saying that he met someone at an undisclosed place without us?</ScenarioTalk46_124>
    <ScenarioTalk46_125>Aeuros, AKA Windy Light or Wings of the Sky, is a mysterious spiritual creature...</ScenarioTalk46_125>
    <ScenarioTalk46_126>I took the liberty of decoding the ancient book while you were gone.</ScenarioTalk46_126>
    <ScenarioTalk46_127>It said the Disciples of the Light used Aeuros to seek help from the elves and dwarves dwelling outside the Barrier.</ScenarioTalk46_127>
    <ScenarioTalk46_128>Then... Was that giant eagle the mysterious Aeuros??!</ScenarioTalk46_128>
    <ScenarioTalk46_129>- Yulia nodded and continued to speak -</ScenarioTalk46_129>
    <ScenarioTalk46_130>Aeuros is originally the messenger of the God of Fate.</ScenarioTalk46_130>
    <ScenarioTalk46_131>He has the power to take the Pilgrim of Light anywhere using his gigantic wings.</ScenarioTalk46_131>
    <ScenarioTalk46_132>So... Does this mean that I can travel anywhere I want?!</ScenarioTalk46_132>
    <ScenarioTalk46_133>Yes! You can finally go to places beyond the Barrier!!</ScenarioTalk46_133>
    <ScenarioTalk46_134>Beyond the Barrier!! The world of the dwarves and elves! I can finally go to the Metal Tower and Elysium!!</ScenarioTalk46_134>
    <ScenarioTalk46_135>Great job... I am happy for you...!</ScenarioTalk46_135>
    <ScenarioTalk46_136>- After looking at happily smiling Nuri, Jimon, and Yulia, you turned your head towards the distance beyond the Barrier. -</ScenarioTalk46_136>
    <ScenarioTalk46_137>- To a place beyond the Barrier! -</ScenarioTalk46_137>
    <ScenarioTalk46_138>- Another adventure!!! Another journey... -</ScenarioTalk46_138>
    <ScenarioTalk46_139>- ...is waiting for you!! You are ecstatic! -</ScenarioTalk46_139>
    
    <ScenarioTalk47_1>- You went to the Magic Shop early in the morning to get Yulia's advice. -</ScenarioTalk47_1>
    <ScenarioTalk47_2>You can probably go anywhere even without a ship, if you were selected by Aeuros.</ScenarioTalk47_2>
    <ScenarioTalk47_3>Aeuros is also known as the Messenger of Wind....</ScenarioTalk47_3>
    <ScenarioTalk47_4>Just think of a place you wish to go to. Aeuros will take you to where ever you thought of!</ScenarioTalk47_4>
    <ScenarioTalk47_5>World of the Elves, the World of the Dwarfs, Elysium, and Metal Tower!</ScenarioTalk47_5>
    <ScenarioTalk47_6>- You grinned and nodded -</ScenarioTalk47_6>
    <ScenarioTalk47_7>But... you may be worried.</ScenarioTalk47_7>
    <ScenarioTalk47_8>- Yulia hesitated with a sad expression on her face -</ScenarioTalk47_8>
    <ScenarioTalk47_9>- You asked Yulia for more details -</ScenarioTalk47_9>
    <ScenarioTalk47_10>Since the past, the Elves and the Dwarfs have always been arch enemies of each other.</ScenarioTalk47_10>
    <ScenarioTalk47_11>Why has there been such a rumor? Even I don't know the reason for it.</ScenarioTalk47_11>
    <ScenarioTalk47_12>Maybe finding out the truth for yourself is much better than the unreliable rumors.</ScenarioTalk47_12>
    <ScenarioTalk47_13>- Yulia continued with a smile -</ScenarioTalk47_13>
    <ScenarioTalk47_14>Maybe finding out for yourself is not a bad idea. And meet old friends and set off on an adventure!</ScenarioTalk47_14>
    <ScenarioTalk47_15>Take care of yourself.</ScenarioTalk47_15>
    <ScenarioTalk47_16>- After responding to Yulia, you continued on your journey -</ScenarioTalk47_16>
    <ScenarioTalk47_17>- Beyond the Barrier....... -</ScenarioTalk47_17>
    
    <ScenarioTalk48_1>- With the help from Aeuros, you quickly arrived at the Metal Tower. The World of Steel and Boulders that was once only a story... -</ScenarioTalk48_1>
    <ScenarioTalk48_2>- As the name indicated, there were rocks and metals all over the place -</ScenarioTalk48_2>
    <ScenarioTalk48_3>- Isn't anyone here? -</ScenarioTalk48_3>
    <ScenarioTalk48_4>- Some is running towards you from distance. -</ScenarioTalk48_4>
    <ScenarioTalk48_5>- Are you...? -</ScenarioTalk48_5>
    <ScenarioTalk48_6>What! Who are you? How dare you come to this place!&#10;Hmm... you look like those cheating long ears!</ScenarioTalk48_6>
    <ScenarioTalk48_7>- The mysterious man continued without giving me a second to respond -</ScenarioTalk48_7>
    <ScenarioTalk48_8>You must be their spy! I am the Captain of the Guards of the Metal Tower. I'll show you what happens to the spies!</ScenarioTalk48_8>
    <ScenarioTalk48_9>Hey! Get rid of this good for nothing long ear!</ScenarioTalk48_9>
    <ScenarioTalk48_10>What? How can he control these weird monster? Who is this guy?</ScenarioTalk48_10>
    <ScenarioTalk48_11>- Someone is running towards you from a distance -</ScenarioTalk48_11>
    <ScenarioTalk48_12>Great! Perfect timing!! Stop this devilish creature!!</ScenarioTalk48_12>
    <ScenarioTalk48_13>Hey, cat got your tongue? Hey, Arnold! What's wrong?</ScenarioTalk48_13>
    <ScenarioTalk48_14>- A familiar dwarf slowly approached you -</ScenarioTalk48_14>
    <ScenarioTalk48_15>- No way...? -</ScenarioTalk48_15>
    <ScenarioTalk48_16>What the? Hey! Aren't you?</ScenarioTalk48_16>
    <ScenarioTalk48_17>- Arnold seemed overjoyed to see you -</ScenarioTalk48_17>
    <ScenarioTalk48_18>What in the world are you doing here? Oh my lord! I'd never thought I'd see you here. Is this a dream?</ScenarioTalk48_18>
    <ScenarioTalk48_19>- You tell him that you are here to explore the Metal Tower and Elysium. -</ScenarioTalk48_19>
    <ScenarioTalk48_20>Hmm... that sense of adventure... you still at it! So you came on a ship, right?&#10;How was the voyage? Good sea? There was some heavy rain last night.......</ScenarioTalk48_20>
    <ScenarioTalk48_21>- You grinned and told him that you didn't traveled by boat -</ScenarioTalk48_21>
    <ScenarioTalk48_22>What? What do you mean? No ship? Then what?</ScenarioTalk48_22>
    <ScenarioTalk48_23>- You explained about Aeuros and how you flew here on him -</ScenarioTalk48_23>
    <ScenarioTalk48_24>Eu... Aeuros? You mean the giant bird? You never seem to surprise me. Anyway.......</ScenarioTalk48_24>
    <ScenarioTalk48_25>Come! Follow me! I've got a lots to show you. Ha, ha, ha!!</ScenarioTalk48_25>
    <ScenarioTalk48_26>- You followed Arnold. -</ScenarioTalk48_26>
    
    <ScenarioTalk48_27>Oh, I almost forgot. We're currently at war with those conniving long ears!</ScenarioTalk48_27>
    <ScenarioTalk48_28>Remember that menacing look my Dogi gave you before?</ScenarioTalk48_28>
    <ScenarioTalk48_29>It doesn't matter how much of a good friend you are to me. You're still an outsider.&#10;So you need to build trust here.</ScenarioTalk48_29>
    <ScenarioTalk48_30>And to start, can you get some minerals known as the Blue Crystals?&#10;It's a very important resource that is essential to win the war!</ScenarioTalk48_30>
    <ScenarioTalk48_31>They are very difficult to get, so if you get it for us, then I'm sure others will start to accept you.</ScenarioTalk48_31>
    <ScenarioTalk48_32>I know it's cumbersome but it's all for your own good.&#10;According to recent rumors... that Blue Crystal... Yea! They say that it's been spotted in the Graveyard of Machines.</ScenarioTalk48_32>
    <ScenarioTalk48_33>So why don't you just go right on over to the Graveyard of Machines and try to get that Blue Crystal. In the mean time, I'll try to bribe some of the guards at the gate of the Mineral Valley....</ScenarioTalk48_33>
    <ScenarioTalk48_34>What? You're back already? Then you have that valuable Blue Crystal?&#10;Just as I remember! You have some amazing skills!</ScenarioTalk48_34>
    <ScenarioTalk48_35>Great! Let's go. I'm sure those guards at the gate will drool over this and let us pass through.&#10;Actually, this thing is really expensive item here.</ScenarioTalk48_35>
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk49_1>Now that we're in the Metal Tower, I guess I should give you some general overview of the area, right?</ScenarioTalk49_1>
    <ScenarioTalk49_2>The Metal Tower is broken down into four regions and one castle!</ScenarioTalk49_2>
    <ScenarioTalk49_3>The Mineral Valley, Graveyard of Machines, Gate of Colossus, Fire Dragon Nest, and Dwarf's Castle Oderon, where we live.</ScenarioTalk49_3>
    <ScenarioTalk49_4>For some unknown reasons, the living things in the area have become violent&#10;and the machines started to malfunction and have been attacking the dwarfs and rampaging through the village.</ScenarioTalk49_4>
    <ScenarioTalk49_5>- Unknown reasons...? -</ScenarioTalk49_5>
    <ScenarioTalk49_6>Yup! Even I don't know why. But one thing for sure! Something really bad is going on in this region!</ScenarioTalk49_6>
    <ScenarioTalk49_7>- ....... -</ScenarioTalk49_7>
    <ScenarioTalk49_8>Lastly, the people you will meet often are Miruba at the Shop&#10;and that Garrison Captain you met before, Capt. Dogi, and our King Srorin.</ScenarioTalk49_8>
    <ScenarioTalk49_9>Oh, there's also Noble Borutus. He is a stubborn one and I advise you to stay away from him if possible.</ScenarioTalk49_9>
    <ScenarioTalk49_10>Actually, he has a way of turning all things negative. He claims that my adventure stories are all lies, and when I mention you, he makes that ugly face!</ScenarioTalk49_10>
    <ScenarioTalk49_11>He is undoubtedly loyal to Srorin, but .. I don't know. Maybe jealousy?&#10;Anyway, there's no telling what's bothering him so much.</ScenarioTalk49_11>
    <ScenarioTalk49_12>Well, it seems like there's no urgent issue today, so let's take it easy!</ScenarioTalk49_12>
    <ScenarioTalk49_13>- You smile and nod. -</ScenarioTalk49_13>
    <ScenarioTalk49_14>Hmm... Dogi said that he sighted monsters in the vicinity of Mineral Vallye.</ScenarioTalk49_14>
    <ScenarioTalk49_15>The next region is the Gate of Colossus, which is the area under the management of Noble Borutus.&#10;So he will not let an outsider, let along you, get passed. Did I say he is stubborn? That's putting it mildly!</ScenarioTalk49_15>
    <ScenarioTalk49_16>But I heard that he will let anyone in if they are willing to assist in investigating a certain monster.</ScenarioTalk49_16>
    <ScenarioTalk49_17>What was that. Anyway, let's try to find that monster thing. Who knows, it might show up if we search the Mineral Valley area.</ScenarioTalk49_17>
    <ScenarioTalk49_18>- You can see trace of black object on the minerals. What is going on here? -</ScenarioTalk49_18>
    <ScenarioTalk49_19>Numerous ores are carved out. This is not the work of a dwarf.&#10;Who can possibly break such a hard ore?</ScenarioTalk49_19>
    <ScenarioTalk49_20>- Dwarf's guard machines are broken up and scattered in the area. It definitely shows signs of small and large combats! -</ScenarioTalk49_20>
    <ScenarioTalk49_21>There has surely been an intrusion by an unknown enemy. Investigation result like this will surely satisfy even Noble Borutus. Let's go back!</ScenarioTalk49_21>
    <ScenarioTalk49_22>Borutus was thrilled with our work and approved my passage through the Gate of Colossus.&#10;But it seems like he still doesn't trust you. Gosh I feel bad about all this.</ScenarioTalk49_22>
    <ScenarioTalk49_23>- You tell Arnold thanks for trying. -</ScenarioTalk49_23>
    <ScenarioTalk49_24>And that's what I like about you! Great!&#10;Anyway, you need to get over to Castle Oderon ASAP! I don't know why but they have urgently asked to find you and me.</ScenarioTalk49_24>
    
    <ScenarioTalk50_1>- Arnold showed you the way to the Castle. -</ScenarioTalk50_1>
    <ScenarioTalk50_2>- Castle made of steel and boulder was armed with numerous dwarfs and menacing machines. -</ScenarioTalk50_2>
    <ScenarioTalk50_3>- While you were still awed with the surroundings, Arnold stopped walking. -</ScenarioTalk50_3>
    <ScenarioTalk50_4>We're here. You see over there? He's the Dwarf King Srorin!</ScenarioTalk50_4>
    <ScenarioTalk50_5>- The beautiful gemstones in the majestic throne... and even more dignifying posture of a Dwarf. -</ScenarioTalk50_5>
    <ScenarioTalk50_6>- His face showed the wisdom, experience, and cunning of countless years. -</ScenarioTalk50_6>
    <ScenarioTalk50_7>- Suddenly, a sharp voice cut through the solemnness of the moment. -</ScenarioTalk50_7>
    <ScenarioTalk50_8>Arnold! How dare you touring with your friend at times like these?</ScenarioTalk50_8>
    <ScenarioTalk50_9>- Is that Borutus? But what's going on, anyway? -</ScenarioTalk50_9>
    <ScenarioTalk50_10>Suspicious shadow has been sighted in various parts of the Metal Tower for a few days now.&#10;But you would know nothing about that, of course!</ScenarioTalk50_10>
    <ScenarioTalk50_11>- Suspicious shadow? -</ScenarioTalk50_11>
    <ScenarioTalk50_12>Really? I knew about the increasing ambush by the monsters, but...</ScenarioTalk50_12>
    <ScenarioTalk50_13>What do you mean, suspicious shadow?</ScenarioTalk50_13>
    <ScenarioTalk50_14>Still the fool Arnold! Please stop dishonoring your father, may God rest his soul! Aren't you ashamed?</ScenarioTalk50_14>
    <ScenarioTalk50_15>What did you say?</ScenarioTalk50_15>
    <ScenarioTalk50_16>Arnold! Borutus! Stop both of you! What is this childishness in front of a guest?</ScenarioTalk50_16>
    <ScenarioTalk50_17>One more commotion out of either of you in my castle, and I'll have you turned over to the military court!</ScenarioTalk50_17>
    <ScenarioTalk50_18>.......</ScenarioTalk50_18>
    <ScenarioTalk50_19>.......</ScenarioTalk50_19>
    <ScenarioTalk50_20>.... It's been a long time, my friend. It seems like you've been well over the years. Welcome!</ScenarioTalk50_20>
    <ScenarioTalk50_21>- He is Srorin? The King of the Metal Tower? -</ScenarioTalk50_21>
    <ScenarioTalk50_22>I'm sure you've just heard... and for a few days now, we've detected movements by strangers within the Metal Tower.</ScenarioTalk50_22>
    <ScenarioTalk50_23>- Suspicious strangers? You mean there are more than one? -</ScenarioTalk50_23>
    <ScenarioTalk50_24>Yes. They have easily defeated our powerful garrison soldiers, and are wandering around the Tower in search of something.</ScenarioTalk50_24>
    <ScenarioTalk50_25>And I think I know what it is that they're after.</ScenarioTalk50_25>
    <ScenarioTalk50_26>And if they are really after that itme, then... they will being unspeakable terror into the Metal Tower!</ScenarioTalk50_26>
    <ScenarioTalk50_27>- Unspeakable Terror? -</ScenarioTalk50_27>
    <ScenarioTalk50_28>And we can't go after them with all our force.......&#10;As you can see, we are currently at war with the Elves.</ScenarioTalk50_28>
    <ScenarioTalk50_29>We are at war to gain and maintain control over the precious resource that will help us fight against the monsters. Yes, the Blue Crystal.</ScenarioTalk50_29>
    <ScenarioTalk50_30>Yes. The side that runs short of the Blue Crystal will be annihilated by the monsters...</ScenarioTalk50_30>
    <ScenarioTalk50_31>.... I know it's all so sudden, but can you help us?</ScenarioTalk50_31>
    <ScenarioTalk50_32>Someone like you, I'm sure you can turn the balance of the war!</ScenarioTalk50_32>
    <ScenarioTalk50_33>- Borutus looked shocked all of sudden, and started to approach you. -</ScenarioTalk50_33>
    <ScenarioTalk50_34>My lord! My lord! The monsters... the monsters! </ScenarioTalk50_34>
    <ScenarioTalk50_35>What is it, Borutus?</ScenarioTalk50_35>
    <ScenarioTalk50_36>The monsters have appeard at the Gate of Colossus. Already, numerous garrison soldiers have been killed by them!</ScenarioTalk50_36>
    <ScenarioTalk50_37>What? Call all the garrison of the kingdom! We must stop them!</ScenarioTalk50_37>
    <ScenarioTalk50_38>How dare they cause trouble on my land! I shall bring death to them all!</ScenarioTalk50_38>
    <ScenarioTalk50_39>Hey, let's follow the King!</ScenarioTalk50_39>
    <ScenarioTalk50_40>- You nodded to Arnold. Black Robe! Yes! Maybe it's them! -</ScenarioTalk50_40>
    <ScenarioTalk50_41>I will go with the King to the Gate of Colossus. All of you, follow us!</ScenarioTalk50_41>
    <ScenarioTalk50_42>Maybe the things are worse than it seems. You should be well prepared!</ScenarioTalk50_42>
    <ScenarioTalk50_43>- You nodded to Arnold, and rushed over to the Gate of Colossus. -</ScenarioTalk50_43>
    
    <ScenarioTalk50_44>Dogi clearly said that the enemy wearing Black Robe has ran off this way!</ScenarioTalk50_44>
    <ScenarioTalk50_45>Maybe we'll find something out if we eliminate the Red-Blooded Carlos that the Black Robe control!</ScenarioTalk50_45>
    <ScenarioTalk50_46>Alright! Let's go! How dare they invade our home. I shall show them fear!</ScenarioTalk50_46>
    <ScenarioTalk50_47>That's strange. I definitely felt something strange from this one....... &#10;Look at its eyes. It's definitely under some kind of hypnotism!</ScenarioTalk50_47>
    <ScenarioTalk50_48>I haven't seen monster coming down this far, yet...... oh..my ...lor~~~dddd!</ScenarioTalk50_48>
    <ScenarioTalk50_49>- Powerful magic knocked down Arnold! -</ScenarioTalk50_49>
    <ScenarioTalk50_50>...How dare you get in my way!</ScenarioTalk50_50>
    <ScenarioTalk50_51>- Apostle of Black Robe! -</ScenarioTalk50_51>
    <ScenarioTalk50_52>Oh, ho! Are you the one I've heard so much about?</ScenarioTalk50_52>
    <ScenarioTalk50_53>- What's he talking about? -</ScenarioTalk50_53>
    <ScenarioTalk50_54>How there you interfere with His plan... I commend you for your courage.</ScenarioTalk50_54>
    <ScenarioTalk50_55>But it's that courage that will get you killed! </ScenarioTalk50_55>
    <ScenarioTalk50_56>Kuueeekkkk. Why, you...</ScenarioTalk50_56>
    <ScenarioTalk50_57>Alright! It's time to clean up the trash!</ScenarioTalk50_57>
    <ScenarioTalk50_58>Kuueekkk! I will bring death to your heart! Kkaahhkkk!</ScenarioTalk50_58>
    <ScenarioTalk50_59>Hey, Arnold! Wake up!</ScenarioTalk50_59>
    <ScenarioTalk50_60>Owe~... Bo... Borutus?</ScenarioTalk50_60>
    <ScenarioTalk50_61>You bugs! I don't care how many of you there are! Come..on... wooohoo~~~ Ouuccchhh!</ScenarioTalk50_61>
    <ScenarioTalk50_62>How dare you set your foot in the Metal Tower! You filthy Wizard!</ScenarioTalk50_62>
    <ScenarioTalk50_63>- When Srorin glared at the Black Robe with vengeful eyes, the Black Robe started to step back. -</ScenarioTalk50_63>
    <ScenarioTalk50_64>Humph... you've lived too long, old king. It doesn't matter. My comrades in Elysium probably started their work by now!</ScenarioTalk50_64>
    <ScenarioTalk50_65>I'm done with my mission, so long! Kuhaha~ haha~!</ScenarioTalk50_65>
    <ScenarioTalk50_66>Why... stop!</ScenarioTalk50_66>
    <ScenarioTalk50_67>Borutus... calm down. We need to take care of wounded Arnold, first.</ScenarioTalk50_67>
    <ScenarioTalk50_68>Ouuchhhh....</ScenarioTalk50_68>
    <ScenarioTalk50_69>I am going to see Dogi and ask him to reinforce the guards at the Metal Tower.</ScenarioTalk50_69>
    <ScenarioTalk50_70>- Achieved his mission? Elysium? What's going on here? -</ScenarioTalk50_70>
    <ScenarioTalk50_71>Some hero! Look at you now! You just made Arnold look like even a bigger fool!</ScenarioTalk50_71>
    <ScenarioTalk50_72>Stop! Arnold rushed forward recklessly. And that Wizard also commanded very powerful magic!</ScenarioTalk50_72>
    <ScenarioTalk50_73>.......</ScenarioTalk50_73>
    <ScenarioTalk50_74>My Lord, I have concentrated our guards on the outer perimeter of the Castle! Other areas will soon be reinforced, as you have ordered, My Lord!</ScenarioTalk50_74>
    <ScenarioTalk50_75>Great. Borutus. Follow me. Let's look around the other area, and see what the enemies are up to.</ScenarioTalk50_75>
    <ScenarioTalk50_76>Ah! Arnold was not that seriously injured. He's a tough one so don't worry!</ScenarioTalk50_76>
    <ScenarioTalk50_77>He was asking for you as soon as he woke up, so why don't you go and see him? I need to check on the guard machines. So long!</ScenarioTalk50_77>
    <ScenarioTalk50_78>- It seems like Arnold is looking for you. You should go and see him. -</ScenarioTalk50_78>
    
    <ScenarioTalk51_1>Hey, why are you looked so worried like that? Look. My arms and legs are still atached... Don't worry!</ScenarioTalk51_1>
    <ScenarioTalk51_2>Where are you headed now? Don't tell me that you are going back to Yutakan, are you?</ScenarioTalk51_2>
    <ScenarioTalk51_3>- You tell Arnold that you want to scout around the Metal Tower region. -</ScenarioTalk51_3>
    <ScenarioTalk51_4>Hmm... that's a good idea. There are more than a few of them, so there's no telling what they are conspiring!</ScenarioTalk51_4>
    <ScenarioTalk51_5>I've obtained approval for all the regions, so go ahead. You are cleared to investigate the area!</ScenarioTalk51_5>
    <ScenarioTalk51_6>- You nodded with a big smile -</ScenarioTalk51_6>
    <ScenarioTalk51_7>But, I don't think you can get into the Fire Dragon Nest. The guards there are no joke, you know....</ScenarioTalk51_7>
    <ScenarioTalk51_8>Both Borutus and the King are all edgy ever since the appearance of the Black Robes.</ScenarioTalk51_8>
    <ScenarioTalk51_9>First, check out all the areas thoroughly, except for the Fire Dragon Nest!</ScenarioTalk51_9>
    <ScenarioTalk51_10>I will talk to who ever I need to talk to and get you cleared for that area, as well. In the mean time, good luck. See you later!</ScenarioTalk51_10>
    <ScenarioTalk51_11>- You split up with Arnold, and looked at the Metal Tower. -</ScenarioTalk51_11>
    <ScenarioTalk51_12>- Apostle of Black Robe.... -</ScenarioTalk51_12>
    <ScenarioTalk51_13>- Just what are they conspiring? -</ScenarioTalk51_13>
    <ScenarioTalk51_14>- May be you should investigate the entire areas of the Metal Tower, just to be prepared for the unexpected. -</ScenarioTalk51_14>
    
    <ScenarioTalk52_1>- You met with Arnold and talked about what you've learned so far. It seems Arnold also hasn't had much luck in finding clues. -</ScenarioTalk52_1>
    <ScenarioTalk52_2>I see. I tried to check out a few things, but it's amazing at how little or no clue there are. Humph!</ScenarioTalk52_2>
    <ScenarioTalk52_3>Well, then there's only one place we haven't checked out, yet. It's the Fire Dragon Nest.</ScenarioTalk52_3>
    <ScenarioTalk52_4>- Fire Dragon Nest... it's the region that Borutus forbade us from going near. -</ScenarioTalk52_4>
    <ScenarioTalk52_5>Actually, there was some rumor about suspicious shadows appearing in the vicinity of the Fire Dragon Nest.&#10;But because of so many monsters in other regions, we soon forgot.</ScenarioTalk52_5>
    <ScenarioTalk52_6>Maybe all the monsters appearing all of sudden here and there is nothing more than camouflage to keep the rumors down about those shadows over there!</ScenarioTalk52_6>
    <ScenarioTalk52_7>If the rumor about the suspicious shadows is true, than... maybe they are there to unlock the seal and release the terrifying Fire Dragon?</ScenarioTalk52_7>
    <ScenarioTalk52_8>- Seal of the Fire Dragon? -</ScenarioTalk52_8>
    <ScenarioTalk52_9>Ah... nothing... never mind. What am I talking about? Well, let's check out this area a bit more...</ScenarioTalk52_9>
    <ScenarioTalk52_10>Hey, Arnold! Now's not the time to just relax and take things easy!</ScenarioTalk52_10>
    <ScenarioTalk52_11>What? What do you mean relaxing? I'm on investigation... yea, I was taking a small break...but anyway!</ScenarioTalk52_11>
    <ScenarioTalk52_12>It's that! It's....!</ScenarioTalk52_12>
    <ScenarioTalk52_13>Ka... Kaciz! The Fire Dragon Kaciz has awakened!</ScenarioTalk52_13>
    <ScenarioTalk52_14>Wa... what?</ScenarioTalk52_14>
    <ScenarioTalk52_15>- Arnold's face changed suddenly. It was a face of a man who has experienced unimaginable terror. -</ScenarioTalk52_15>
    <ScenarioTalk52_16>It's got to be a hoax from some deranged lunatic. Ka.. Kaciz... awakened from its seal?</ScenarioTalk52_16>
    <ScenarioTalk52_17>I'm sorry to be that lunatic who has witnessed the dragon!</ScenarioTalk52_17>
    <ScenarioTalk52_18>... you're kidding... right?</ScenarioTalk52_18>
    <ScenarioTalk52_19>I'm serious! I've seen it with my very own eyes! &#10;But its seal was not completely broken. So it is not out of its nest, yet.</ScenarioTalk52_19>
    <ScenarioTalk52_20>No way... how can... who could've weakened the seal? How can the Fire Dragon Kaciz, that can devastate the entire Metal Tower, be free from its seal?</ScenarioTalk52_20>
    <ScenarioTalk52_21>- Borutus nodded in grave expression to Srorin's inquiry. -</ScenarioTalk52_21>
    <ScenarioTalk52_22>Yes, my lord. Kaciz will surely break free from its seal and devastate this Metal Tower with fire, once again!</ScenarioTalk52_22>
    <ScenarioTalk52_23>According to a witness statement by a garrison soldier in the Fire Dragon Nest region, suspicious enemies appeared and knocked down the guards, then headed towards the Fire Dragon Nest.</ScenarioTalk52_23>
    <ScenarioTalk52_24>- Srorin and Borutus frowned in deep concern. It was Arnold's voice that broke the silence. -</ScenarioTalk52_24>
    <ScenarioTalk52_25>Well, then! It's simple. Just leave it all to me. I will crush that Fire Dragon!</ScenarioTalk52_25>
    <ScenarioTalk52_26>Stop making senseless comments, Arnold! It will burn you even before you get near it!</ScenarioTalk52_26>
    <ScenarioTalk52_27>Humph!</ScenarioTalk52_27>
    <ScenarioTalk52_28>- After a long silence, Srorin spoke. -</ScenarioTalk52_28>
    <ScenarioTalk52_29>It's not over, yet. We still have him!</ScenarioTalk52_29>
    <ScenarioTalk52_30>My lord! Do you really believe this outsider?</ScenarioTalk52_30>
    <ScenarioTalk52_31>Arnold trusts and depends on him. Don't tell me you suspect Arnold?</ScenarioTalk52_31>
    <ScenarioTalk52_32>...no... my lord, but...</ScenarioTalk52_32>
    <ScenarioTalk52_33>Right! He can help us! Well, how about it? Want to give us a hand?</ScenarioTalk52_33>
    <ScenarioTalk52_34>- You nodded without a hesitation. -</ScenarioTalk52_34>
    <ScenarioTalk52_35>Thank you. If the hero of Yutakan helps us, then we have nothing to fear!</ScenarioTalk52_35>
    <ScenarioTalk52_36>I will call for you if Kaciz breaks free of its seal and come out from the nest. Defeating him is simple. Just kill it!</ScenarioTalk52_36>
    <ScenarioTalk52_37>Well... if it was Dogi... I'm sure it will be the other way around.</ScenarioTalk52_37>
    <ScenarioTalk52_38>What did you say?</ScenarioTalk52_38>
    <ScenarioTalk52_39>I don't trust you... but we have no choice. But if you betray us, I shall not forgive you!</ScenarioTalk52_39>
    <ScenarioTalk52_40>You first need to investigate, so I'll grant you the passage to the Fire Dragon Nest.</ScenarioTalk52_40>
    <ScenarioTalk52_41>Well, if Kaciz breaks free of its seal and comes out of its nest, then we will call for you. Please help us!</ScenarioTalk52_41>
    <ScenarioTalk52_42>- You nodded and walked out of the Castle Oderon. -</ScenarioTalk52_42>
    <ScenarioTalk52_43>- Black Robes are continuously sighted in various regions of the Dwarf's continent. -</ScenarioTalk52_43>
    <ScenarioTalk52_44>- What are they up to? -</ScenarioTalk52_44>
    <ScenarioTalk52_45>Amazing! I never though that you can actually defeat that monster!</ScenarioTalk52_45>
    <ScenarioTalk52_46>Ah, it's not over yet. It possesses unimaginable and terrifying power.</ScenarioTalk52_46>
    <ScenarioTalk52_47>- You saw the seriousness in Arnold's face and asked him why. -</ScenarioTalk52_47>
    <ScenarioTalk52_48>I didn't tell you everything, but Kaciz is an awesome beast!</ScenarioTalk52_48>
    <ScenarioTalk52_49>It almost annihilated the Metal Tower. It killed countless dwarfs and devasted the continent...</ScenarioTalk52_49>
    <ScenarioTalk52_50>But with a sacrifice of brave dwarf brothers, we got a chance at an opening, and was able to knock him down. And then we sealed him in the Fire Dragon Nest.</ScenarioTalk52_50>
    <ScenarioTalk52_51>Well, I've heard this story from my dad when I was young, so I don't know what those brothers are. Ha, ha, hat!</ScenarioTalk52_51>
    <ScenarioTalk52_52>Anyway... What's your plan? Are you going to go back to Yutakan?</ScenarioTalk52_52>
    <ScenarioTalk52_53>- You reply that the thing Black Robe said about Elysium keeps on bothering you. -</ScenarioTalk52_53>
    <ScenarioTalk52_54>I see. You are worried about those long ears? Well... it's all good.</ScenarioTalk52_54>
    <ScenarioTalk52_55>That's what I like about you. You're kind soul!</ScenarioTalk52_55>
    <ScenarioTalk52_56>Well then, what are you waiting for? Go! Monsters will be blocking your way come night fall, so you'd better get started now. Take care of yourself!</ScenarioTalk52_56>
    <ScenarioTalk52_57>And if that terrifying Fire Dragon Kaciz show up again, I'll be sure to call for you!</ScenarioTalk52_57>
    <ScenarioTalk52_58>- You nodded in response to Arnold, and got on Aeuros. -</ScenarioTalk52_58>
    <ScenarioTalk52_59>- Home of Florence.... the lands of forest and spirits, just what will be in store in Elysium? -</ScenarioTalk52_59>
    
    <ScenarioTalk53_1>- Small lights glitter in the forest filled with beautiful trees. -</ScenarioTalk53_1>
    <ScenarioTalk53_2>- It's beautiful sight to behold. -</ScenarioTalk53_2>
    <ScenarioTalk53_3>- How about moving a bit farther? -</ScenarioTalk53_3>
    <ScenarioTalk53_4>- !!!!!!!!!!! -</ScenarioTalk53_4>
    <ScenarioTalk53_5>Who are you? I haven't seen you around here before!</ScenarioTalk53_5>
    <ScenarioTalk53_6>Get out of this forest, or I'll consider you an enemy!</ScenarioTalk53_6>
    <ScenarioTalk53_7>- A life form never seen before. It's as if a human and a horse have morphed. -</ScenarioTalk53_7>
    <ScenarioTalk53_8>- You approached, and tried to explain, but sharp arrows blocked your path. -</ScenarioTalk53_8>
    <ScenarioTalk53_9>- It seems like words won't do. -</ScenarioTalk53_9>
    <ScenarioTalk53_10>Why are you staring like that? Oh, so you're not going to back off!</ScenarioTalk53_10>
    <ScenarioTalk53_11>What? Who is this guy? How can he command such a giant monster? Is he an evil sorcerer?</ScenarioTalk53_11>
    <ScenarioTalk53_12>Alright you evil sorcerer! I will take care of you myself....</ScenarioTalk53_12>
    <ScenarioTalk53_13>- A sharp arrow from a far distance pierced through the sky! -</ScenarioTalk53_13>
    <ScenarioTalk53_14>What the?</ScenarioTalk53_14>
    <ScenarioTalk53_15>- ! -</ScenarioTalk53_15>
    <ScenarioTalk53_16>Stop! He's not an enemy!</ScenarioTalk53_16>
    <ScenarioTalk53_17>- When you turned towards where the arrow came from, there stood an Elf with a bright smile. -</ScenarioTalk53_17>
    <ScenarioTalk53_18>Long time no see! I really didn't think you would come here. Welcome!</ScenarioTalk53_18>
    <ScenarioTalk53_19>- Florence grasped your both hands with bright smile. -</ScenarioTalk53_19>
    <ScenarioTalk53_20>F... Florence? What are you saying? What do you mean he's not an enemy. Are you alright?</ScenarioTalk53_20>
    <ScenarioTalk53_21>It's him! He's the one who rescued me in Yutakan, and helped me find our precious spirit!</ScenarioTalk53_21>
    <ScenarioTalk53_22>Ah... oh my, I'm really sorry. I didn't know...</ScenarioTalk53_22>
    <ScenarioTalk53_23>My name is Daiross. I'm the Garrison Commander of Elysium.</ScenarioTalk53_23>
    <ScenarioTalk53_24>We are currently at war with the Dwarfs... so I'm pretty edgy. Sorry for making the mistake.</ScenarioTalk53_24>
    <ScenarioTalk53_25>- Florence, still holding your both hands, led the way. -</ScenarioTalk53_25>
    <ScenarioTalk53_26>Here, let me show you the way. Follow me!</ScenarioTalk53_26>
    <ScenarioTalk53_27>- You followed Florence and exited the Spirit Forest. -</ScenarioTalk53_27>
    <ScenarioTalk53_28>.......</ScenarioTalk53_28>
    <ScenarioTalk53_29>Ah! If you have some time, can you help me? I'm sure I can finish it much faster with your help!</ScenarioTalk53_29>
    <ScenarioTalk53_30>- You smiled and nodded. -</ScenarioTalk53_30>
    <ScenarioTalk53_31>Ho, ho. Thank you. It's not that difficult. I was assigned with a mission by Queen Aidra in defeating the Tainted Spirits in the forest.</ScenarioTalk53_31>
    <ScenarioTalk53_32>But they are much powerful than I expected... and to be hones, I'm having a difficult time.</ScenarioTalk53_32>
    <ScenarioTalk53_33>I will also eliminate them, but can you help me by killing about %1$s Tainted Spirits?</ScenarioTalk53_33>
    <ScenarioTalk53_34>Wow! Finished already? Did you really eliminate all those Tainted Spirits already? </ScenarioTalk53_34>
    <ScenarioTalk53_35>All I killed are 1. You still amaze me.</ScenarioTalk53_35>
    <ScenarioTalk53_36>- Florence mumbled something and looked like she was very disappointed in herself. You smiled and told her it was alright. -</ScenarioTalk53_36>
    <ScenarioTalk53_37>Hmm... since you helped me finish my mission, I shall be your guide through Elysium. Just follow me!</ScenarioTalk53_37>
    
    <ScenarioTalk54_1>I was really surprised when I saw you. Why didn't you let me know in advance? I'd have prepared for your arrival...</ScenarioTalk54_1>
    <ScenarioTalk54_2>- You told here that there was no way to send a word. -</ScenarioTalk54_2>
    <ScenarioTalk54_3>Ah! I didn't realize that there's no way to get in contact from your world with our world. Sorry.</ScenarioTalk54_3>
    <ScenarioTalk54_4>- You smiled lightly, and asked her about detailed information about Elysium. -</ScenarioTalk54_4>
    <ScenarioTalk54_5>Ah... Elysium is the world of the Spirits and Forest. Of course, it's also Elves' home!</ScenarioTalk54_5>
    <ScenarioTalk54_6>The regions include 4 major exploration zones and 1 residential zone.&#10;Spirit Forest, Forest Valley, Ancient Ruins, Tree of Life, and Parucondoro, which is the Elf's Castle.</ScenarioTalk54_6>
    <ScenarioTalk54_7>- You ask about the on going war with Dwarfs.... -</ScenarioTalk54_7>
    <ScenarioTalk54_8>Ah, have you been to the Metal Tower?</ScenarioTalk54_8>
    <ScenarioTalk54_9>- You nodded. -</ScenarioTalk54_9>
    <ScenarioTalk54_10>Well... we both have different values, and different life pattern... so we fight each other but....</ScenarioTalk54_10>
    <ScenarioTalk54_11>Recently, we started to use Blue Crystals to effectively block out the monsters...</ScenarioTalk54_11>
    <ScenarioTalk54_12>And we fight a lot with Dwarfs over this Blue Crystal. Of course, I guess we are fighting to survive from the monsters.</ScenarioTalk54_12>
    <ScenarioTalk54_13>- You asked about when the monsters started to appear, and information on them. -</ScenarioTalk54_13>
    <ScenarioTalk54_14>Well, all I know is that the number of monsters has increased recently... just what are they and why are they attacking Parucondoro? That I don't know.</ScenarioTalk54_14>
    <ScenarioTalk54_15>All we know is that these monsters are weak against the Blue Crystals.</ScenarioTalk54_15>
    <ScenarioTalk54_16>And because of that, the frequency of fights against the Dwarfs has increased. All for the control over the crystals.</ScenarioTalk54_16>
    <ScenarioTalk54_17>Well, enough of serious conversation. Let's look around and get some rest!</ScenarioTalk54_17>
    <ScenarioTalk54_18>And if we can get a chance, maybe you can visit Parucondoro and see the Queen.</ScenarioTalk54_18>
    <ScenarioTalk54_19>...Well... I think the problem with the monsters attacking Parucondoro is more serious than the war with the Dwarfs.</ScenarioTalk54_19>
    <ScenarioTalk54_20>- Florence spoke the words out without thinking. -</ScenarioTalk54_20>
    <ScenarioTalk54_21>All the elves are scouting the area and are preparing against the ambush by the monsters.</ScenarioTalk54_21>
    <ScenarioTalk54_22>So maybe we should check out the area also and help other elves.</ScenarioTalk54_22>
    <ScenarioTalk54_23>Even Queen Aidra is also out on a scout mission. So I want to help whenever I can.</ScenarioTalk54_23>
    <ScenarioTalk54_24>Well, let me show you around. Just follow me!</ScenarioTalk54_24>
    <ScenarioTalk54_25>- Like Metal Tower, this region is also under attack by the monsters. -</ScenarioTalk54_25>
    <ScenarioTalk54_26>- ...Maybe the Black Robe is also conspiring something evil in this region, as well? -</ScenarioTalk54_26>
    <ScenarioTalk54_27>- Let's put the worry aside for now, and follow Florence. Maybe it will be fun! -</ScenarioTalk54_27>
    <ScenarioTalk54_28>- Surely... -</ScenarioTalk54_28>
    <ScenarioTalk54_29>- Terrifying scream of a monster came from the Forest Valley area! Florence rushed over to you! -</ScenarioTalk54_29>
    <ScenarioTalk54_30>It's terrible! All the garrison soldiers that went on scout mission to the Forest Valley came back with serious injuries!</ScenarioTalk54_30>
    <ScenarioTalk54_31>They are all great warriors... There must be something more terrifying than monsters in the Forest Valley!</ScenarioTalk54_31>
    <ScenarioTalk54_32>I'm sorry for this but can you come with me to check out the area?</ScenarioTalk54_32>
    <ScenarioTalk54_33>- You nodded and rushed towards Forest Valley with Florence. -</ScenarioTalk54_33>
    <ScenarioTalk54_34>- The leaves in the Forest Valley are being contaminated and turning balck.... -</ScenarioTalk54_34>
    <ScenarioTalk54_35>This contamination is definitely caused by magic. But it's strange... I've never seen anything like this before... and I can feel enormous power from it.</ScenarioTalk54_35>
    <ScenarioTalk54_36>- You calmed Florence down, and told her that this area needs to be investigated further. -</ScenarioTalk54_36>
    <ScenarioTalk54_37>The spirits in the Forest Valley are frightened. But I don't know what they are scared of.</ScenarioTalk54_37>
    <ScenarioTalk54_38>- You investigated the area thoroughly, but there's nothing here. All you learned is that very powerful magic is encircling the region. -</ScenarioTalk54_38>
    <ScenarioTalk54_39>Magic power this strong is more than enough to defeat our garrison soldiers. We definitely have intruder in Elysium!</ScenarioTalk54_39>
    <ScenarioTalk54_40>First, we must report this information to Queen Aidra in Parucondoro.</ScenarioTalk54_40>
    <ScenarioTalk54_41>- You nodded. -</ScenarioTalk54_41>
    <ScenarioTalk54_42>Follow me! I will lead you to Parucondoro, the Castle of Elves.</ScenarioTalk54_42>
    
    <ScenarioTalk55_1>- Castle Parucondoro was a beautiful sight to behold. But inside the walls of the castle, there was deep concern and silence. -</ScenarioTalk55_1>
    <ScenarioTalk55_2>- You felt someone staring at you as you looked around the castle. -</ScenarioTalk55_2>
    <ScenarioTalk55_3>.......</ScenarioTalk55_3>
    <ScenarioTalk55_4>- An Elf with piercing eyes passed by you. -</ScenarioTalk55_4>
    <ScenarioTalk55_5>- Who was that? -</ScenarioTalk55_5>
    <ScenarioTalk55_6>That's Angelo. He is a noble with the most power, and highly respected among other nobles.</ScenarioTalk55_6>
    <ScenarioTalk55_7>He comes from a family that has served Queen Aidra loyally for many generations.</ScenarioTalk55_7>
    <ScenarioTalk55_8>The reason for his sharp expression is probably due to the bad rumor that's been going around lately.</ScenarioTalk55_8>
    <ScenarioTalk55_9>- Bad rumor? -</ScenarioTalk55_9>
    <ScenarioTalk55_10>Well... anyway.. we're here! Look!</ScenarioTalk55_10>
    <ScenarioTalk55_11>It's been a long time.</ScenarioTalk55_11>
    <ScenarioTalk55_12>- A beautiful Elf was standing besides a window through which warm ray of sun was shining. -</ScenarioTalk55_12>
    <ScenarioTalk55_13>- But the moment of mystic was broken by a sharp voice. -</ScenarioTalk55_13>
    <ScenarioTalk55_14>My Queen! The rumor was true! What we have dreaded has happened!</ScenarioTalk55_14>
    <ScenarioTalk55_15>- Queen Aidra's eyes opened wide and she couldn't suppress her shock. -</ScenarioTalk55_15>
    <ScenarioTalk55_16>The Black... the Black Robed stranger was sighted nearby the village, again!</ScenarioTalk55_16>
    <ScenarioTalk55_17>- Someone approached behind excited Angelo. -</ScenarioTalk55_17>
    <ScenarioTalk55_18>Angelo is correct. And it seems like they are moving around with a purpose!</ScenarioTalk55_18>
    <ScenarioTalk55_19>According to our investigation, it seems like they are in search of something as they move through the Spirit Forest, and the Forest Valley.</ScenarioTalk55_19>
    <ScenarioTalk55_20>What do you mean? In search of what?</ScenarioTalk55_20>
    <ScenarioTalk55_21>- Barutaon took a breath to calm down, and continued. -</ScenarioTalk55_21>
    <ScenarioTalk55_22>...Maybe... these Black Robe strangers... maybe they are looking for that.</ScenarioTalk55_22>
    <ScenarioTalk55_23>... Oh, then we can't just sit around and watch anymore.</ScenarioTalk55_23>
    <ScenarioTalk55_24>- Queen Aidra looked at you and spoke. -</ScenarioTalk55_24>
    <ScenarioTalk55_25>Strangers wearing Black Robe started to appear continuously in Elysium, not too long ago.</ScenarioTalk55_25>
    <ScenarioTalk55_26>Everytime our garrison soldiers chased after them, they used evil sorcery or summoned monsters with unknown means, and escaped from our soldiers.</ScenarioTalk55_26>
    <ScenarioTalk55_27>Of course, we are doing our best to capture them, but it seems like they somehow escape our trap, every time.</ScenarioTalk55_27>
    <ScenarioTalk55_28>Please, help us. I have no doubt that you have the power and skills to defeat them!</ScenarioTalk55_28>
    <ScenarioTalk55_29>- You nod to Queen Aidra. -</ScenarioTalk55_29>
    <ScenarioTalk55_30>- You reply that you know a little about them, and what power they possess. -</ScenarioTalk55_30>
    <ScenarioTalk55_31>Humans! Always words and never backs what they spit out!</ScenarioTalk55_31>
    <ScenarioTalk55_32>My Queen, I shall organize the guards and thoroughly search the vicinity of Elysium!</ScenarioTalk55_32>
    <ScenarioTalk55_33>I'm sure I can achieve better result than this human, who is all talk and no action...</ScenarioTalk55_33>
    <ScenarioTalk55_34>Angelo, please stop!</ScenarioTalk55_34>
    <ScenarioTalk55_35>.......</ScenarioTalk55_35>
    <ScenarioTalk55_36>Now is not the time to argue with each other. We must cooperate. Please stop being selfish.</ScenarioTalk55_36>
    <ScenarioTalk55_37>My Queen. I have checked the regions where the Black Robe strangers have been sighted.</ScenarioTalk55_37>
    <ScenarioTalk55_38>- Queen Aidra nodded as Barutaon spoke. -</ScenarioTalk55_38>
    <ScenarioTalk55_39>I've taken too much of your time. My apologies. I shall be on my way now.</ScenarioTalk55_39>
    <ScenarioTalk55_40>- Queen Aidra moved to another region, followed by many Elves. -</ScenarioTalk55_40>
    <ScenarioTalk55_41>Humph! Let's see how well you'll do. If you're just all talk, then you'll be sorry that you ever met me.</ScenarioTalk55_41>
    <ScenarioTalk55_42>Of course, you are no way near my match... but I'll still keep my eyes on you.</ScenarioTalk55_42>
    <ScenarioTalk55_43>!!!!!!!!!</ScenarioTalk55_43>
    <ScenarioTalk55_44>- Angelo expressed his anger at you and then walked off with other nobles. -</ScenarioTalk55_44>
    <ScenarioTalk55_45>- Ambush by monsters in Elysium, unknown rumor, and the Apostle of Black Robe -</ScenarioTalk55_45>
    <ScenarioTalk55_46>- Just what are they up to here? -</ScenarioTalk55_46>
    <ScenarioTalk55_47>Da... Daiross has just reported that a massive number of monsters have just ambushed the village!</ScenarioTalk55_47>
    <ScenarioTalk55_48>Queen Aidra, Angelo, and numerous garrison soldiers have headed to the Ancient Ruins, but we haven't heard from them, yet....</ScenarioTalk55_48>
    <ScenarioTalk55_49>This is terrible. Something doesn't feel right. Please help me. Let's go to the Ancient Ruins!</ScenarioTalk55_49>
    <ScenarioTalk55_50>Oh, no! This can't be!</ScenarioTalk55_50>
    <ScenarioTalk55_51>- Numerous garrison soldiers were lying injured throughout the grounds of the Ancient Ruins. It seems like there has been a fierce battle here. -</ScenarioTalk55_51>
    <ScenarioTalk55_52>Kuukkk... We never saw the trap. Those evil ... they used monsters to lure us into a trap!</ScenarioTalk55_52>
    <ScenarioTalk55_53>Angelo? Where are the others? Where's Queen Aidra? Weren't you with the Queen?</ScenarioTalk55_53>
    <ScenarioTalk55_54>Qu.. Queen... Ah... we've no time to lose. Florence, don't worry about me! Quickly! Our Queen is in danger!</ScenarioTalk55_54>
    <ScenarioTalk55_55>...I can't believe that I'm asking a human for help but... please, help us. Please save our Queen!</ScenarioTalk55_55>
    <ScenarioTalk55_56>- You nodded to Angelo, and rushed into the deepest part of the Ancient Ruins. -</ScenarioTalk55_56>
    <ScenarioTalk55_57>- When you arrived at the heart of the Ancient Ruins, there were countless monsters lying dead all over the grounds. And behind them, sharp eyed Elf was staring at something... or someone... -</ScenarioTalk55_57>
    <ScenarioTalk55_58>My Queen!</ScenarioTalk55_58>
    <ScenarioTalk55_59>Florence, don't come any closer!</ScenarioTalk55_59>
    <ScenarioTalk55_60>...that's...?</ScenarioTalk55_60>
    <ScenarioTalk55_61>Kuukuukkk! Worthy of a true Queen of Elysium. It's amazing that you defeated all those monsters, and made this far, alone. You got my respect!</ScenarioTalk55_61>
    <ScenarioTalk55_62>- Queen Aidra stared at the Black Robe with deadly anger in her eyes, and spoke. -</ScenarioTalk55_62>
    <ScenarioTalk55_63>Why have you used the monsters to attack us? Who are you and why are you doing this?</ScenarioTalk55_63>
    <ScenarioTalk55_64>Oh, ho! Don't tell me that intelligent and know-it-all Queen like you don't know what I was up to.</ScenarioTalk55_64>
    <ScenarioTalk55_65>Wa... What?</ScenarioTalk55_65>
    <ScenarioTalk55_66>Kuukkuuukkuu! We shall see... Oh, I can't wait to see the terrifying expressions on all your faces!</ScenarioTalk55_66>
    <ScenarioTalk55_67>How dare you to speak that way to our Queen!</ScenarioTalk55_67>
    <ScenarioTalk55_68>- Florence shot salvo of piercing arrows towards the Black Robe. -</ScenarioTalk55_68>
    <ScenarioTalk55_69>Oh, ho! Temper! Temper! But you can't stop me!</ScenarioTalk55_69>
    <ScenarioTalk55_70>While you were busy fighting my decoys here, my work was finished. Pu~hahaha!</ScenarioTalk55_70>
    <ScenarioTalk55_71>So all the things that has happened so far was the work of that intruder. Do you know anything about that Black Robe?</ScenarioTalk55_71>
    <ScenarioTalk55_72>- You tell Queen Aidra all you know about the Black Robe. -</ScenarioTalk55_72>
    <ScenarioTalk55_73>You mean that we have such a terrifying enemy in Elysium? What was our garrison and Daiross doing to let such enemy get pass through our gates?</ScenarioTalk55_73>
    <ScenarioTalk55_74>It's not the fault of your garrison nor Daiross. The magic he possess is truly terrifying and way beyond the power of your soldiers. </ScenarioTalk55_74>
    <ScenarioTalk55_75>I'm sure the Black Robe entered Elysium through the passage that is unknown to your garrison and Daiross.</ScenarioTalk55_75>
    <ScenarioTalk55_76>My Queen... do you mean that we have a traitor?</ScenarioTalk55_76>
    <ScenarioTalk55_77>I'm not certain so let's keep our mouth shut. Unfounded rumor will only cause more fear among the elves.</ScenarioTalk55_77>
    <ScenarioTalk55_78>Yes, My Queen.</ScenarioTalk55_78>
    <ScenarioTalk55_79>We will join Daiross and help him defend Elysium. Please take care of yourself, My Queen.</ScenarioTalk55_79>
    <ScenarioTalk55_80>- You tell Queen Aidra and Angelo alright, and ran towards Florence. -</ScenarioTalk55_80>
    
    <ScenarioTalk56_1>Who would've thought that they have set a trap for our Queen.</ScenarioTalk56_1>
    <ScenarioTalk56_2>- Florence continued to speak in concerned tone. -</ScenarioTalk56_2>
    <ScenarioTalk56_3>Barutaon clearly said that they were after something. &#10;Maybe their continuous attack on the village is just a decoy, to keep our attention away from their real purpose.</ScenarioTalk56_3>
    <ScenarioTalk56_4>But it's hard to say what they are after.</ScenarioTalk56_4>
    <ScenarioTalk56_5>- What can they be after in Elysium? -</ScenarioTalk56_5>
    <ScenarioTalk56_6>Their movement was very active every time the monsters attacked in large number.</ScenarioTalk56_6>
    <ScenarioTalk56_7>Maybe the monsters are just a decoy to keep our attention away. Maybe their true purpose is at somewhere else!</ScenarioTalk56_7>
    <ScenarioTalk56_8>Their path started from the Spirit Forest, Forest Valley, Ancient Ruins.... no way! Tree of Life?</ScenarioTalk56_8>
    <ScenarioTalk56_9>But Tree of Life is a restricted area, authorized only by Angelo and Queen Aidra.</ScenarioTalk56_9>
    <ScenarioTalk56_10>...The only thing we can do now is to find their trace!</ScenarioTalk56_10>
    <ScenarioTalk56_11>- You agreed with Florence. -</ScenarioTalk56_11>
    <ScenarioTalk56_12>Let's go! I'm sure we'll find something if we continue to investigate.</ScenarioTalk56_12>
    <ScenarioTalk56_13>- Florence made an effort to smile, and led the way. -</ScenarioTalk56_13>
    <ScenarioTalk56_14>- The same thing that happened in the Metal Tower is happening in Elysium. This is not good. -</ScenarioTalk56_14>
    <ScenarioTalk56_15>- We should first investigate Elysium, thoroughly. We must stop their conspiracy! -</ScenarioTalk56_15>
    <ScenarioTalk56_16>- Maybe Florence is right. You should thoroughly investigate Elysium, first! -</ScenarioTalk56_16>
    
    <ScenarioTalk57_1>- You are investigating all parts of Elysium, together with Florence. -</ScenarioTalk57_1>
    <ScenarioTalk57_2>- ...But there's no trace of the enemy. Are you wasting time? -</ScenarioTalk57_2>
    <ScenarioTalk57_3>There's no trace of them, anywhere...</ScenarioTalk57_3>
    <ScenarioTalk57_4>- You comforted and encouraged Florence. -</ScenarioTalk57_4>
    <ScenarioTalk57_5>But we can't give up. We must keep searching.</ScenarioTalk57_5>
    <ScenarioTalk57_6>Weird sound started to come from the area of the Tree of Life ever since we started to fight against the Black Robe and their monsters. It's eerie and terrifying sound.</ScenarioTalk57_6>
    <ScenarioTalk57_7>- Earth started to rumble all of sudden, then terrifying monster sound engulfed the forest! -</ScenarioTalk57_7>
    <ScenarioTalk57_8>Yes. It's this sound. The sound of monsters and vibration. It's exactly the same!</ScenarioTalk57_8>
    <ScenarioTalk57_9>What? Why are you here? Quickly! Follow me!</ScenarioTalk57_9>
    <ScenarioTalk57_10>Who, me?</ScenarioTalk57_10>
    <ScenarioTalk57_11>Both of you!</ScenarioTalk57_11>
    <ScenarioTalk57_12>- Everyone was gathered. And they all had grave expression on their faces. Something bas has happened, for sure. -</ScenarioTalk57_12>
    <ScenarioTalk57_13>Those evil... we never expected that they were after Kronak's Egg. I was such a fool for not seeing this coming!</ScenarioTalk57_13>
    <ScenarioTalk57_14>It's not your fault Angelo. They planned this very well.</ScenarioTalk57_14>
    <ScenarioTalk57_15>But... they already planted the Kronak's Egg in the Tree of Life... Oh, no!</ScenarioTalk57_15>
    <ScenarioTalk57_16>I'm certain that they have planted Kronak's Egg in the Tree of Life. But according to the ancient records, we are not out of hope, yet!</ScenarioTalk57_16>
    <ScenarioTalk57_17>In the past, our ancestors have faced Evil Kronak and defeated the beast by using the power of the nature.</ScenarioTalk57_17>
    <ScenarioTalk57_18>We can... we can defeat... Kronak?</ScenarioTalk57_18>
    <ScenarioTalk57_19>What's going on? Is it true that Kronak's Egg has been stolen?</ScenarioTalk57_19>
    <ScenarioTalk57_20>...It's all my fault. While all of us were after them, the guards guarding Kronak's Egg were ambushed... and.....</ScenarioTalk57_20>
    <ScenarioTalk57_21>- Angelo lowered his head with shame, and Queen Aidra silently looked with solem expression. -</ScenarioTalk57_21>
    <ScenarioTalk57_22>Evil Kronak of Genesis almost brought annihilation to Elysium.&#10;We defeated Kronak, but the we were not able to destroy its venomous egg.</ScenarioTalk57_22>
    <ScenarioTalk57_23>But I heard that Kronak's Egg was hidden deep in the Tree of Life. How could they have known?</ScenarioTalk57_23>
    <ScenarioTalk57_24>All the garrison soldiers guarding the Kronak's Egg are loyal and highly elite soldiers.... &#10;To be able to defeat them all at once and take the egg... it's not a work of a sinle person!</ScenarioTalk57_24>
    <ScenarioTalk57_25>- It must be the Black Robes! Just what can they be after? -</ScenarioTalk57_25>
    <ScenarioTalk57_26>Let me be blunt. Kronak will feed on the Tree of Life and grow to be a giant in no time!</ScenarioTalk57_26>
    <ScenarioTalk57_27>Can you help us destroy Kronak?</ScenarioTalk57_27>
    <ScenarioTalk57_28>My Queen, what are you saying? How can you ask evil human for help?</ScenarioTalk57_28>
    <ScenarioTalk57_29>- You reply that you will help. -</ScenarioTalk57_29>
    <ScenarioTalk57_30>Thank you....</ScenarioTalk57_30>
    <ScenarioTalk57_31>...Humph!</ScenarioTalk57_31>
    <ScenarioTalk57_32>That's reassuring. Now the way to defeat it....</ScenarioTalk57_32>
    <ScenarioTalk57_33>- Queen Aidra turned and looked at Barutaon. As if he was waiting for this moment, he approached you. -</ScenarioTalk57_33>
    <ScenarioTalk57_34>Kronak is a terrifying beast. There's no doubt about that. But it does have its weaknesses. It's substance known as Ether of Forest, and it possesses the power of nature.</ScenarioTalk57_34>
    <ScenarioTalk57_35>Elysium is a one large life form. And when Kronak appears, Elysium will generate the Ether of Forest.</ScenarioTalk57_35>
    <ScenarioTalk57_36>Collect the Ether of Forest from the Spirit Forest, Forest Valley, and the Ancient Ruins.&#10;When you collect sufficient amount, then you can defeat Kronak.</ScenarioTalk57_36>
    <ScenarioTalk57_37>Kronak is still feeding off the Tree of Life from its roots. If you attack now, the Tree may get irrevocably damaged. &#10;You must wait until it grows and shows itself. I shall send for your help, then.</ScenarioTalk57_37>
    <ScenarioTalk57_38>And I will authorize your access to the restricted Tree of Life area. Please go and investigate the region, first.</ScenarioTalk57_38>
    <ScenarioTalk57_39>Please, be our savior.</ScenarioTalk57_39>
    <ScenarioTalk57_40>- You smiled and nodded... but something didn't feel right. -</ScenarioTalk57_40>
    <ScenarioTalk57_41>- Apostle of Black Robe... Just what are they up to here? -</ScenarioTalk57_41>
    <ScenarioTalk57_42>Amazing! No one actually believed that you can really defeat that giant bug Kronak.</ScenarioTalk57_42>
    <ScenarioTalk57_43>...Thank you. Now other Elves and spirits can remain safely in the forest.</ScenarioTalk57_43>
    <ScenarioTalk57_44>But... those Black Robes... why did they commit such evil conspiracy in Elysium?</ScenarioTalk57_44>
    <ScenarioTalk57_45>No matter how powerful they may be,&#10;they must be deeply wounded in fighting countless Elf soldiers, especially the elite guards when they stole Kronak's Egg.</ScenarioTalk57_45>
    <ScenarioTalk57_46>- You agreed with Florence's suspicion. -</ScenarioTalk57_46>
    <ScenarioTalk57_47>.......</ScenarioTalk57_47>
    <ScenarioTalk57_48>- You were surprised with Florence's sudden expression of sadness, and you asked why. -</ScenarioTalk57_48>
    <ScenarioTalk57_49>...I didn't tell you everything before. Evil Kronak of Genesis was a being with awesome power.</ScenarioTalk57_49>
    <ScenarioTalk57_50>It's a beast that almost annihilated Elysium in the past. And if this ever happens again, we will never be able to protect our kingdom on our own.</ScenarioTalk57_50>
    <ScenarioTalk57_51>- You reassured Florence that you will help when ever the Elves need your help. -</ScenarioTalk57_51>
    <ScenarioTalk57_52>Ah....</ScenarioTalk57_52>
    <ScenarioTalk57_53>Thank you! Thank you very much. If you will help us, then there's nothing to worry!</ScenarioTalk57_53>
    <ScenarioTalk57_54>Well... where to next?</ScenarioTalk57_54>
    <ScenarioTalk57_55>- You tell Florence that you are going back to Yutakan, together with Aeuros. -</ScenarioTalk57_55>
    <ScenarioTalk57_56>I see. I will pray for safe journey. And, please come back to Elysium anytime!</ScenarioTalk57_56>
    <ScenarioTalk57_57>- You smile brightly at Florence, and quickly got on Aeuros. -</ScenarioTalk57_57>
    
    <ScenarioTalk58_1>Did you enjoy your trip to Metal Tower and Elysium?</ScenarioTalk58_1>
    <ScenarioTalk58_2>...You don't look like you enjoyed the trip.</ScenarioTalk58_2>
    <ScenarioTalk58_3>- You told Yulia about the adventures in the Metal Tower and Elysium. -</ScenarioTalk58_3>
    <ScenarioTalk58_4>- Yulia was concerned for briefly, but took a deep breath and spoke quietly. -</ScenarioTalk58_4>
    <ScenarioTalk58_5>They... they always have clear purpose on everything they do.</ScenarioTalk58_5>
    <ScenarioTalk58_6>...Maybe it has something to do with the resurrection of Kades, the Evil God of Darkness and Destruction.</ScenarioTalk58_6>
    <ScenarioTalk58_7>But light will shine through even at the end of such darkness. And don't forget! That light is you.</ScenarioTalk58_7>
    <ScenarioTalk58_8>- ....... -</ScenarioTalk58_8>
    <ScenarioTalk58_9>Trust in your power and potentials.</ScenarioTalk58_9>
    <ScenarioTalk58_10>Then you shall be able to overcome anything.</ScenarioTalk58_10>
    <ScenarioTalk58_11> I believe it.</ScenarioTalk58_11>
    <ScenarioTalk58_12>- You smiled and nodded at Yulia. -</ScenarioTalk58_12>
    <ScenarioTalk58_13>- New adventures and mysterious beings await you on the other side of the Barrier. -</ScenarioTalk58_13>
    <ScenarioTalk58_14>- It may be an exciting adventure, but also an unbearable trial. -</ScenarioTalk58_14>
    <ScenarioTalk58_15>- But you must go forward. -</ScenarioTalk58_15>
    <ScenarioTalk58_16>- To the other side of the Barrier.... -</ScenarioTalk58_16>
    <ScenarioTalk58_17>- Towards greater and mysterious world.... -</ScenarioTalk58_17>
    
    <!-- 엔피씨 시나리오 시작 -->
    <ScenarioTalk59_1>After exploring, we arrived at the village later than expected. </ScenarioTalk59_1>
    <ScenarioTalk59_2>First... We should go to inn and take a rest... Huh?!</ScenarioTalk59_2>
    <ScenarioTalk59_3>I just hear sound of monsters from distance! Where is it?!</ScenarioTalk59_3>
    <ScenarioTalk59_4>A herd of monsters is surrounding Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk59_4>
    <ScenarioTalk59_5>Oh no! My legs!!</ScenarioTalk59_5>
    <ScenarioTalk59_6>Cowards! Ganging up on an injured person!!</ScenarioTalk59_6>
    <ScenarioTalk59_7>The herd found me and began approaching</ScenarioTalk59_7>
    <ScenarioTalk59_8>Look out! They feel different from other monsters!</ScenarioTalk59_8>
    <ScenarioTalk59_9>I nodded and called my dragon</ScenarioTalk59_9>
    <ScenarioTalk59_10>W...Wow! Defeating all those monsters just took a moment!</ScenarioTalk59_10>
    <ScenarioTalk59_11>I'm sorry. I was attacked by surprise and injured legs. Then those monsters ganged up on me!</ScenarioTalk59_11>
    <ScenarioTalk59_12>If it wasn't for you, I would have been in a big trouble! Thank you so much!!</ScenarioTalk59_12>
    <ScenarioTalk59_13>I asked where other guards are</ScenarioTalk59_13>
    <ScenarioTalk59_14>Kanggalo looked away then began talking after a sigh.</ScenarioTalk59_14>
    <ScenarioTalk59_15>An unknown monster appeared, then people stopped applying to become guard...</ScenarioTalk59_15>
    <ScenarioTalk59_16>The monster is so powerful that many guards ran away..</ScenarioTalk59_16>
    <ScenarioTalk59_17>So monsters are now invading this village...</ScenarioTalk59_17>
    <ScenarioTalk59_18>If someone takes care of the monster, guards and applicants will return...</ScenarioTalk59_18>
    <ScenarioTalk59_19>I asked Kanggalo for information about the monster</ScenarioTalk59_19>
    <ScenarioTalk59_20>W, what?! You will take care of the monster?</ScenarioTalk59_20>
    <ScenarioTalk59_21>If we don't do something, villagers will be in great danger.</ScenarioTalk59_21>
    <ScenarioTalk59_22>Fearlessly, I nodded to Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk59_22>

    <ScenarioTalk60_1>I took out memo Kanggalo gave me </ScenarioTalk60_1>
    <ScenarioTalk60_2>The memo is blood stained. It must be from someone who survived a brutal battle </ScenarioTalk60_2>
    <ScenarioTalk60_3>How powerful is it that it made so many brave warriors run away?</ScenarioTalk60_3>
    <ScenarioTalk60_4>Shaking away concerns, I began reading the memo. </ScenarioTalk60_4>
    <ScenarioTalk60_5>Morning, cloudy. IT is not moving.</ScenarioTalk60_5>
    <ScenarioTalk60_6>It is a defensive monster... We should first deal with its minions in its base. </ScenarioTalk60_6>
    <ScenarioTalk60_7>When its minions are defeated, it will appear. –Guard exploration log-</ScenarioTalk60_7>
    <ScenarioTalk60_8>Fomas... It is boss monster in [Forest of Hope].</ScenarioTalk60_8>
    <ScenarioTalk60_9>It appears only during [Night]! We should hurry!</ScenarioTalk60_9>
    <ScenarioTalk60_10>Fomas is defeated, but other monsters don't seem affected.. </ScenarioTalk60_10>
    <ScenarioTalk60_11>They might be smarter than they look..</ScenarioTalk60_11>
    <ScenarioTalk60_12>Does it know that I am looking for it?</ScenarioTalk60_12>
    <ScenarioTalk60_13>Let's go back and ask Kanggalo and others for their opinion. </ScenarioTalk60_13>
    <ScenarioTalk60_14>This is a waste of time. </ScenarioTalk60_14>
    
    <ScenarioTalk61_1>I visited Kanggalo to ask about the memo</ScenarioTalk61_1>
    <ScenarioTalk61_2>Kanggalo is usually very cheerful, but today he seems gaunt</ScenarioTalk61_2>
    <ScenarioTalk61_3>Hello, how can I help you?</ScenarioTalk61_3>
    <ScenarioTalk61_4>With a welcoming smile, Yulia came</ScenarioTalk61_4>
    <ScenarioTalk61_5>I told her I need to speak with Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk61_5>
    <ScenarioTalk61_6>Yulia looked concerned</ScenarioTalk61_6>
    <ScenarioTalk61_7>There must have been a monster with powerful poison among those that attacked Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk61_7>
    <ScenarioTalk61_8>Mr. Kanggalo is weak from the deadly poison</ScenarioTalk61_8>
    <ScenarioTalk61_9> Only if you can find [Herb] that grow in [Blizzard Mountain(night)]...</ScenarioTalk61_9>
    <ScenarioTalk61_10>I told Yulia that I will find the herb</ScenarioTalk61_10>
    <ScenarioTalk61_11>B, but it is not easy to find.. Also, there are many monsters...</ScenarioTalk61_11>
    <ScenarioTalk61_12>I assured Yulia that I will find it, and hurried to Blizzard Mountain</ScenarioTalk61_12>
    <ScenarioTalk61_13>...Please be safe</ScenarioTalk61_13>
    <ScenarioTalk61_14>This is...?!</ScenarioTalk61_14>
    <ScenarioTalk61_15>Th, thank you! I will make potion now!!</ScenarioTalk61_15>
    <ScenarioTalk61_16>...I owe you so much. You are a good person.</ScenarioTalk61_16>
    <ScenarioTalk61_17>Huh...  They are poisonous... They more cunning than I thought.</ScenarioTalk61_17>
    <ScenarioTalk61_18>Did the memo help? Did you find it?!</ScenarioTalk61_18>
    <ScenarioTalk61_19>I told him I did not find it</ScenarioTalk61_19>
    <ScenarioTalk61_20>No way... If the memo doesn't help....</ScenarioTalk61_20>
    <ScenarioTalk61_21>Soon! When the monster invades this village, we can't stop it!!</ScenarioTalk61_21>
    <ScenarioTalk61_22>What should we do! </ScenarioTalk61_22>
    <ScenarioTalk61_23>Mr. Kanggalo, do you know where the monster herd attacked recently?</ScenarioTalk61_23>
    <ScenarioTalk61_24>I do....</ScenarioTalk61_24>
    <ScenarioTalk61_25>Can you mark it on this map?</ScenarioTalk61_25>
    <ScenarioTalk61_26>Yulia stared at the map that Kanggalo marked for a while and began talking.</ScenarioTalk61_26>
    <ScenarioTalk61_27>If I'm not wrong... They're looking for magic stone.</ScenarioTalk61_27>
    <ScenarioTalk61_28>Magic stone? Why?!?!</ScenarioTalk61_28>
    <ScenarioTalk61_29>I do not know why. However, locations of the attacks...</ScenarioTalk61_29>
    <ScenarioTalk61_30>Magic store in the market, magic storage of Mr. Barus, reserve storage of fortuneteller...</ScenarioTalk61_30>
    <ScenarioTalk61_31>Everything is magic item related?!</ScenarioTalk61_31>
    <ScenarioTalk61_32>If we know their goal... Solution is simple.</ScenarioTalk61_32>
    <ScenarioTalk61_33>Prepare a trap?</ScenarioTalk61_33>
    <ScenarioTalk61_34>Yulia smiled and nodded </ScenarioTalk61_34>
    <ScenarioTalk61_35>Underwater Cave is a source of high quality magic stone.</ScenarioTalk61_35>
    <ScenarioTalk61_36>R, right! Coming to think of it, tomorrow is the mining day!</ScenarioTalk61_36>
    <ScenarioTalk61_37>Go to Underwater Cave! Maybe you can find a lead.</ScenarioTalk61_37>
    <ScenarioTalk61_38>When I recover, I will come to help!!</ScenarioTalk61_38>
    <ScenarioTalk61_39>I went to Underwater Cave</ScenarioTalk61_39>
    <ScenarioTalk61_40>Monsters do not need to steal magic stones...</ScenarioTalk61_40>
    <ScenarioTalk61_41>It must be... Related to them. I'm sure...!</ScenarioTalk61_41>
    
    <ScenarioTalk62_1>Like Yulia said, magic stones were everywhere in Underwater Cave.</ScenarioTalk62_1>
    <ScenarioTalk62_2>It must be... Monsters will come to look for magic stones</ScenarioTalk62_2>
    <ScenarioTalk62_3>Demon shelter?! But the looks... Is it under someone's control?!</ScenarioTalk62_3>
    <ScenarioTalk62_4>Kweeek?!</ScenarioTalk62_4>
    <ScenarioTalk62_5>Oh no! It found me!!</ScenarioTalk62_5>
    <ScenarioTalk62_6>You must fight it!!</ScenarioTalk62_6>
    <ScenarioTalk62_7>Goga fell with a scream</ScenarioTalk62_7>
    <ScenarioTalk62_8>But... Guards wouldn't be afraid of goga?</ScenarioTalk62_8>
    <ScenarioTalk62_9>A huge shock struck me. I lost conscience </ScenarioTalk62_9>
    <ScenarioTalk62_10>.......</ScenarioTalk62_10>
    <ScenarioTalk62_11>Are you awake? </ScenarioTalk62_11>
    <ScenarioTalk62_12>S, sorry! I should have gone faster...</ScenarioTalk62_12>
    <ScenarioTalk62_13>Yulia? Kanggalo?! What happened...?!</ScenarioTalk62_13>
    <ScenarioTalk62_14>When we arrived at the cave, magic stones were already taken.</ScenarioTalk62_14>
    <ScenarioTalk62_15>You were lying next to goga... But we couldn't find who did it.</ScenarioTalk62_15>
    <ScenarioTalk62_16>Maybe what attacked you... is what made guards afraid.</ScenarioTalk62_16>
    <ScenarioTalk62_17>Taking you down like that, it might be a really powerful monster...</ScenarioTalk62_17>
    <ScenarioTalk62_18>However... Thanks to you, number of monsters nearby decreased a lot!</ScenarioTalk62_18>
    <ScenarioTalk62_19>Guard applicants are now coming back... Thank you!</ScenarioTalk62_19>
    <ScenarioTalk62_20>It didn't end well. We still don't know what the monster is....</ScenarioTalk62_20>
    <ScenarioTalk62_21>What is the monster that attacked me? Why is it collecting magic stones?</ScenarioTalk62_21>
    <ScenarioTalk62_22>I had many questions, but I couldn't find answers </ScenarioTalk62_22>
    <ScenarioTalk62_23>Is this the last magic stone? ... It took some time. You taking time, that's unusual!</ScenarioTalk62_23>
    <ScenarioTalk62_24>...There was something interesting </ScenarioTalk62_24>
    <ScenarioTalk62_25>Interesting?</ScenarioTalk62_25>
    <ScenarioTalk62_26> Well... Alright. Let's meet at the gathering point.</ScenarioTalk62_26>
    <ScenarioTalk62_27>Join us later.</ScenarioTalk62_27>
    <ScenarioTalk62_28>.......</ScenarioTalk62_28>

    <!-- 고가 전투 패배시 -->
    <ScenarioTalk1062_1>- We can't just give up! -</ScenarioTalk1062_1>
    <ScenarioTalk1062_2>- If we let it be, greater danger might come to the village!! -</ScenarioTalk1062_2>
    <ScenarioTalk1062_3>- Let's go back to crystal Mine! We must defeat it!!! -</ScenarioTalk1062_3>

    <ScenarioTalk63_1>Looking around the village after exploring, I saw Dilis standing looking blank faced</ScenarioTalk63_1>
    <ScenarioTalk63_2>What is her problem? We better go and ask</ScenarioTalk63_2>
    <ScenarioTalk63_3>....</ScenarioTalk63_3>
    <ScenarioTalk63_4>Dilis? What is it? Why are you standing blank faced...</ScenarioTalk63_4>
    <ScenarioTalk63_5>.......</ScenarioTalk63_5>
    <ScenarioTalk63_6>?!</ScenarioTalk63_6>
    <ScenarioTalk63_7>After sobbing for a while, Dilis calmed down</ScenarioTalk63_7>
    <ScenarioTalk63_8>I carefully asked Dilis what happened</ScenarioTalk63_8>
    <ScenarioTalk63_9>...Jimon is avoiding me. I want to be friends with Jimon.</ScenarioTalk63_9>
    <ScenarioTalk63_10>I asked why Jimon is avoiding Dilis</ScenarioTalk63_10>
    <ScenarioTalk63_11>...I, I'm sure Jimon is being shy. I I'm sure!!</ScenarioTalk63_11>
    <ScenarioTalk63_12>?</ScenarioTalk63_12>
    <ScenarioTalk63_13>...That's strange. I should hear both sides of the story!</ScenarioTalk63_13>
    <ScenarioTalk63_14>Jimon ran to Forest of Hope as if Jimon's running away from the village...</ScenarioTalk63_14>
    <ScenarioTalk63_15>What exactly happened in the village?</ScenarioTalk63_15>
    <ScenarioTalk63_16>.......</ScenarioTalk63_16>
    <ScenarioTalk63_17>Jimon looks extremely alert </ScenarioTalk63_17>
    <ScenarioTalk63_18>I asked Jimon why it is in Forest of Hope </ScenarioTalk63_18>
    <ScenarioTalk63_19>Well... The reason is simple. I ran away from something scary.</ScenarioTalk63_19>
    <ScenarioTalk63_20>Something... scary...?</ScenarioTalk63_20>
    <ScenarioTalk63_21>Jimon shook and continued to speak </ScenarioTalk63_21>
    <ScenarioTalk63_22>Yes. It's Dilis! It was awful!!</ScenarioTalk63_22>
    <ScenarioTalk63_23>At first, I just felt something strange going on...</ScenarioTalk63_23>
    <ScenarioTalk63_24>...Even on days exploring with Nuri, something felt weird. </ScenarioTalk63_24>
    <ScenarioTalk63_25>On some days, my favorite snacks were a.l.l. gone!!</ScenarioTalk63_25>
    <ScenarioTalk63_26>My favorite things suddenly disappeared!!</ScenarioTalk63_26>
    <ScenarioTalk63_27>All those wicked things were Dilis's doing!</ScenarioTalk63_27>
    <ScenarioTalk63_28>.......</ScenarioTalk63_28>
    <ScenarioTalk63_29>When I found out, she came to me with an apologetic face...!</ScenarioTalk63_29>
    <ScenarioTalk63_30>Then threw a web, attempting to kidnap me!</ScenarioTalk63_30>
    <ScenarioTalk63_31>"Uhehehe! Let me touch you! Let me examine you!” That's what she said!!</ScenarioTalk63_31>
    <ScenarioTalk63_32>.......</ScenarioTalk63_32>
    <ScenarioTalk63_33>It was an awful experience! I don't want to go through that again!!</ScenarioTalk63_33>
    <ScenarioTalk63_34>I don't want to be friends with Dilis!</ScenarioTalk63_34>
    <ScenarioTalk63_35>I told Dilis about what Jimon said </ScenarioTalk63_35>
    <ScenarioTalk63_36>.......</ScenarioTalk63_36>
    <ScenarioTalk63_37>...It was a small affective gesture. Maybe it was a bit hard to take?</ScenarioTalk63_37>
    <ScenarioTalk63_38>I explained that stalking, stealing, and kidnapping are all crime. </ScenarioTalk63_38>
    <ScenarioTalk63_39>No! It was friendliness gone a bit too far! </ScenarioTalk63_39>
    <ScenarioTalk63_40>But... If that is so, Jimon must reaaaaly hate me!</ScenarioTalk63_40>
    <ScenarioTalk63_41>What should I do? I don't want to be hated by Jimon!</ScenarioTalk63_41>
    <ScenarioTalk63_42>That's right! I have a good idea!! Help me!!!</ScenarioTalk63_42>
    <ScenarioTalk63_43>?!</ScenarioTalk63_43>
    <ScenarioTalk63_44>Help me become friends with Jimon again! You should help me out!!</ScenarioTalk63_44>
    <ScenarioTalk63_45>Let's meet at [Night]! I must be friends with Jimon again!!!</ScenarioTalk63_45>
    <ScenarioTalk63_46>!?!?</ScenarioTalk63_46>

    <ScenarioTalk64_1>Huhuhu! Hero of Yutakan , you don't ignore people in trouble, do you?!</ScenarioTalk64_1>
    <ScenarioTalk64_2>Actually, you're the one who caused the trouble....</ScenarioTalk64_2>
    <ScenarioTalk64_3>What! Anyway! Help me out!!</ScenarioTalk64_3>
    <ScenarioTalk64_4>This is all~ a master plan for cute Jimon!</ScenarioTalk64_4>
    <ScenarioTalk64_5>.......</ScenarioTalk64_5>
    <ScenarioTalk64_6>First, defeat [Damp Vernon] at [Rainbow Lake] [twice]!</ScenarioTalk64_6>
    <ScenarioTalk64_7>[Damp Vernon]? Why?</ScenarioTalk64_7>
    <ScenarioTalk64_8>Then when you defeat it, you must bring chain attached to its weapon!!</ScenarioTalk64_8>
    <ScenarioTalk64_9>Ch, chain?!</ScenarioTalk64_9>
    <ScenarioTalk64_10>Yes! Please do it for me~ I will come up with next plot, I mean plan!!!</ScenarioTalk64_10>
    <ScenarioTalk64_11>Oi...</ScenarioTalk64_11>
    <ScenarioTalk64_12>Defeated Damp Vernon. Let's take the chain as Dilis asked </ScenarioTalk64_12>
    <ScenarioTalk64_13>This should be long enough... But what exactly is Dilis planning?</ScenarioTalk64_13>
    <ScenarioTalk64_14>I don't feel good, but let's take it anyway</ScenarioTalk64_14>
    <ScenarioTalk64_15>Where is Dilis? This was where we were supposed to meet...?</ScenarioTalk64_15>
    <ScenarioTalk64_16>I'm sorry! I came in hurry!! By the way! The chain?!</ScenarioTalk64_16>
    <ScenarioTalk64_17>I handed Dilis the chain </ScenarioTalk64_17>
    <ScenarioTalk64_18>Thanks! Now I can catch... I mean talk to Jimon!!</ScenarioTalk64_18>
    <ScenarioTalk64_19>I'm becoming uncomfortable with this....</ScenarioTalk64_19>
    <ScenarioTalk64_20>Ok! Now next favor!</ScenarioTalk64_20>
    <ScenarioTalk64_21>Again?!</ScenarioTalk64_21>
    <ScenarioTalk64_22>It's all~ for friendship between Jimon and I! You can't help me with that?!</ScenarioTalk64_22>
    <ScenarioTalk64_23>...That's not the issue...</ScenarioTalk64_23>
    <ScenarioTalk64_24>Now I want you to bring me herb famous for aroma!</ScenarioTalk64_24>
    <ScenarioTalk64_25>I think... Herb in Wind Temple are especially! Aromatic!!</ScenarioTalk64_25>
    <ScenarioTalk64_26>Then! I will fix up this chain with Mr. Randolph!</ScenarioTalk64_26>
    <ScenarioTalk64_27>For hunting purposes... I mean to make it more aesthetic and practical!!</ScenarioTalk64_27>
    <ScenarioTalk64_28>Herb at Wind Temple... What is Dilis thinking?</ScenarioTalk64_28>

    <ScenarioTalk65_1>Dilis said herb at [Wind Temple]?</ScenarioTalk65_1>
    <ScenarioTalk65_2>Let's go to [Wind Temple] and get [Herb].</ScenarioTalk65_2>
    <ScenarioTalk65_3>Obtained herb with strange aroma </ScenarioTalk65_3>
    <ScenarioTalk65_4>Let's take this back anyway </ScenarioTalk65_4>
    <ScenarioTalk65_5>Whoa! You really got the herb!!</ScenarioTalk65_5>
    <ScenarioTalk65_6>Then let me combine Mr. Randolph's chain ring and this herb...</ScenarioTalk65_6>
    <ScenarioTalk65_7>Good! Now I can use this to Jimon!!</ScenarioTalk65_7>
    <ScenarioTalk65_8>...What?</ScenarioTalk65_8>
    <ScenarioTalk65_9>Ohohohot!</ScenarioTalk65_9>
    <ScenarioTalk65_10>Dilis ran so fast to the village that I couldn't stop her</ScenarioTalk65_10>
    <ScenarioTalk65_11>After a few minutes, Dilis returned sobbing </ScenarioTalk65_11>
    <ScenarioTalk65_12>Jimon... Hates me even more. All I wanted was to be together</ScenarioTalk65_12>
    <ScenarioTalk65_13>I asked what happened </ScenarioTalk65_13>
    <ScenarioTalk65_14>Smiling... I ran to Jimon to use the chain ring to catch Jimon.</ScenarioTalk65_14>
    <ScenarioTalk65_15>...That's kidnapping</ScenarioTalk65_15>
    <ScenarioTalk65_16>No way... I just wanted to be friends!</ScenarioTalk65_16>
    <ScenarioTalk65_17>.......</ScenarioTalk65_17>
    <ScenarioTalk65_18>.......</ScenarioTalk65_18>
    <ScenarioTalk65_19>Yes! That...That will make Jimon happy!</ScenarioTalk65_19>
    <ScenarioTalk65_20>Dilis suddenly disappeared again </ScenarioTalk65_20>
    
    <ScenarioTalk66_1>What could it be? There seems to be something going on at the village </ScenarioTalk66_1>
    <ScenarioTalk66_2>Dilis disappeared?! What, what's going on?!</ScenarioTalk66_2>
    <ScenarioTalk66_3>Relax! Randolph saw Dilis going somewhere this morning!</ScenarioTalk66_3>
    <ScenarioTalk66_4>What! We can't just stand here! Dilis went to [Tomb of Forest God] alone!</ScenarioTalk66_4>
    <ScenarioTalk66_5>!?</ScenarioTalk66_5>
    <ScenarioTalk66_6>Oh no! Let's hurry and go to [Tomb of Forest God]! Dilis might be in danger!!</ScenarioTalk66_6>
    <ScenarioTalk66_7>What?! Dilis is gone? Really?!</ScenarioTalk66_7>
    <ScenarioTalk66_8>I asked Nuri where Jimon is </ScenarioTalk66_8>
    <ScenarioTalk66_9>Ah~ Jimon is right h... Jimon?!</ScenarioTalk66_9>
    <ScenarioTalk66_10>What? Where did Jimon go?! Jimon was right here just a moment ago!</ScenarioTalk66_10>
    <ScenarioTalk66_11>We don't have time! I headed right to [Tomb of Forest God]</ScenarioTalk66_11>
    <ScenarioTalk66_12>Toratos fell. Where is Dilis?</ScenarioTalk66_12>
    <ScenarioTalk66_13>D, Dilis?! Did you find her?!</ScenarioTalk66_13>
    <ScenarioTalk66_14>I said I couldn't find Dilis yet</ScenarioTalk66_14>
    <ScenarioTalk66_15>What exactly were you doing with Dilis!</ScenarioTalk66_15>
    <ScenarioTalk66_16>.......</ScenarioTalk66_16>
    <ScenarioTalk66_17>Relax Annie. You know it's not his fault. Let's take a look at other places!</ScenarioTalk66_17>
    <ScenarioTalk66_18>We didn't search lower levels yet. Let's go there! Hurry!!</ScenarioTalk66_18>
    <ScenarioTalk66_19>Dilis....</ScenarioTalk66_19>
    <ScenarioTalk66_20>Annie's right. If I stopped Dilis then, this wouldn't have...</ScenarioTalk66_20>
    <ScenarioTalk66_21>We don't have time for this! We should find Dilis!!</ScenarioTalk66_21>
    <ScenarioTalk66_22>?!</ScenarioTalk66_22>
    <ScenarioTalk66_23>I took a wrong step and fell </ScenarioTalk66_23>
    <ScenarioTalk66_24>I didn't hurt myself much, but I was at a strange place </ScenarioTalk66_24>
    <ScenarioTalk66_25>Birds chirping can be heard... Is it dawn?</ScenarioTalk66_25>
    <ScenarioTalk66_26>It was already morning. Dilis is nowhere... Hm?</ScenarioTalk66_26>
    <ScenarioTalk66_27>There is a familiar object in distance. Is that Jimon?!</ScenarioTalk66_27>
    <ScenarioTalk66_28>There are many monsters lying on ground near Jimon </ScenarioTalk66_28>
    <ScenarioTalk66_29>Then Jimon disappearing was because Jimon was worried about Dilis...?</ScenarioTalk66_29>
    <ScenarioTalk66_30>Jimon disliked Dilis on surface, but must have been worried.</ScenarioTalk66_30>
    <ScenarioTalk66_31>Huh?! That's Dilis and Jimon?!</ScenarioTalk66_31>
    <ScenarioTalk66_32> Dilis! You're alright!!</ScenarioTalk66_32>
    <ScenarioTalk66_33>Wha! Finally found you!! You troublemakers!!</ScenarioTalk66_33>
    <ScenarioTalk66_34>I told them that the two are both in deep sleep </ScenarioTalk66_34>
    <ScenarioTalk66_35>Dilis... Looks pretty happy?</ScenarioTalk66_35>
    <ScenarioTalk66_36>In contrast... Jimon looks a bit uncomfortable...</ScenarioTalk66_36>
    <ScenarioTalk66_37>What's important is that Dilis is safe! Ah... I moved around a bit too much. I'm dizzy!</ScenarioTalk66_37>
    <ScenarioTalk66_38>Ark! What are you doing!!</ScenarioTalk66_38>
    <ScenarioTalk66_39>Hey hey! Let's take the two and return to village!!</ScenarioTalk66_39>
    <ScenarioTalk66_40>Well~ After that incident, Jimon is being nicer to Dilis.</ScenarioTalk66_40>
    <ScenarioTalk66_41>"If I lose temper again, Dilis will cause more trouble!" is what Jimon said.</ScenarioTalk66_41>
    <ScenarioTalk66_42>I don't want to wear that!!</ScenarioTalk66_42>
    <ScenarioTalk66_43>No!! It will look really good on you! </ScenarioTalk66_43>
    <ScenarioTalk66_44>I really don't like you!!</ScenarioTalk66_44>
    <ScenarioTalk66_45>Hey~ Don't be shy! Stop right there!!</ScenarioTalk66_45>
    <ScenarioTalk66_46>.......</ScenarioTalk66_46>
    <ScenarioTalk66_47>.......</ScenarioTalk66_47>
    <ScenarioTalk66_48>Well.... Looks like they are bonding...</ScenarioTalk66_48>
    
    <ScenarioTalk67_1>Elpis Village is peaceful as always </ScenarioTalk67_1>
    <ScenarioTalk67_2>Sometimes, relaxing and looking around in the village is better than exploring.</ScenarioTalk67_2>
    <ScenarioTalk67_3>?!</ScenarioTalk67_3>
    <ScenarioTalk67_4>A sudden explosion shook Elpis Village!</ScenarioTalk67_4>
    <ScenarioTalk67_5>Randolph?!</ScenarioTalk67_5>
    <ScenarioTalk67_6>Hmm... So this method is difficult?</ScenarioTalk67_6>
    <ScenarioTalk67_7>That's strange... Why wouldn't my perfect design work?</ScenarioTalk67_7>
    <ScenarioTalk67_8>...Some parts of the experiment are missing.</ScenarioTalk67_8>
    <ScenarioTalk67_9>No! Can't be, Annie! Are you here to laugh at me?!</ScenarioTalk67_9>
    <ScenarioTalk67_10>No... I'm here to help. Relax Randolph.</ScenarioTalk67_10>
    <ScenarioTalk67_11>Ah... Yes. I should calm down. King of invention shouldn't lose temper so easily </ScenarioTalk67_11>
    <ScenarioTalk67_12>That's right~ A handsome face isn't so handsome with wrinkles!</ScenarioTalk67_12>
    <ScenarioTalk67_13>Y... You laughed! You're laughing at me!! </ScenarioTalk67_13>
    <ScenarioTalk67_14>Umm... Maybe we should first consider why our communication is so flawed?</ScenarioTalk67_14>
    <ScenarioTalk67_15>Why are you changing subject? That's right. You must be here to steal my knowledge?!</ScenarioTalk67_15>
    <ScenarioTalk67_16>Sigh... This isn't working out... Huh? Since when were you here?</ScenarioTalk67_16>
    <ScenarioTalk67_17>I said it's been a while </ScenarioTalk67_17>
    <ScenarioTalk67_18>Ah! Good! I will give you an honorable opportunity to help out king of inventions!</ScenarioTalk67_18>
    <ScenarioTalk67_19>?</ScenarioTalk67_19>
    <ScenarioTalk67_20>Don't worry! I will write a line about you on my autobiography!</ScenarioTalk67_20>
    <ScenarioTalk67_21>Randolph~ I can help you out a lot as well!</ScenarioTalk67_21>
    <ScenarioTalk67_22>No! You should remain my rival! I don't cooperate with rivals!</ScenarioTalk67_22>
    <ScenarioTalk67_23>I don't understand, but it seems like you're always thinking about me!</ScenarioTalk67_23>
    <ScenarioTalk67_24>See that? You're changing subject again to make fun of me! We are never on the same line! </ScenarioTalk67_24>
    <ScenarioTalk67_25>Anyway! Let's get out of here and talk. Come!</ScenarioTalk67_25>
    <ScenarioTalk67_26>Umm~ That's Randolph's charms....</ScenarioTalk67_26>
    <ScenarioTalk67_27>Sister! What are you doing here?</ScenarioTalk67_27>
    <ScenarioTalk67_28>That was close! My biggest rival Annie is trying to steal my knowledge!!</ScenarioTalk67_28>
    <ScenarioTalk67_29>No it didn't look anything like that, I said to Randolph </ScenarioTalk67_29>
    <ScenarioTalk67_30>Ah... You don't have to lie for Annie. I know you're a good kid.</ScenarioTalk67_30>
    <ScenarioTalk67_31>What's this nonsense!? </ScenarioTalk67_31>
    <ScenarioTalk67_32>Hmm! Yes! Speaking of Annie, I will tell you about our long messy relationship!</ScenarioTalk67_32>
    <ScenarioTalk67_33>We always had problems with each other...! </ScenarioTalk67_33>
    <ScenarioTalk67_34>She would always wait for me before school, and follow me after school...!</ScenarioTalk67_34>
    <ScenarioTalk67_35>Even when she had to go away to study, she said </ScenarioTalk67_35>
    <ScenarioTalk67_36>"I will never forget you! I will come back for you!!" She cursed me with terrible persistence!!</ScenarioTalk67_36>
    <ScenarioTalk67_37>That's when I realized! We are born to be rivals! I should defeat her!!</ScenarioTalk67_37>
    <ScenarioTalk67_38>.......</ScenarioTalk67_38>
    <ScenarioTalk67_39>So~ That's our brief history! Now you should help me with my invention!!</ScenarioTalk67_39>
    <ScenarioTalk67_40>Please get things written on this memo! Ms. Yulia doesn't have them.</ScenarioTalk67_40>
    <ScenarioTalk67_41>Randolph gave me a very thick pile of paper </ScenarioTalk67_41>
    <ScenarioTalk67_42>Most of the items written can be obtained during night. Start moving at night!</ScenarioTalk67_42>
    <ScenarioTalk67_43>Ok please do that for me! I will happily wait for your arrival!!</ScenarioTalk67_43>
    <ScenarioTalk67_44>Cooperate with me on giving birth to this legendary invention!</ScenarioTalk67_44>
    
    <ScenarioTalk68_1>I read the memo</ScenarioTalk68_1>
    <ScenarioTalk68_2>Necessary items are [Magic Stone]... Location is [Rainbow Lake]?</ScenarioTalk68_2>
    <ScenarioTalk68_3>Then... Shall we go?</ScenarioTalk68_3>
    <ScenarioTalk68_4>Ohhhh! That's [Magic Stone]! Good job!</ScenarioTalk68_4>
    <ScenarioTalk68_5>Randolph took [Magic Stone] and attached it on a weird decoration.</ScenarioTalk68_5>
    <ScenarioTalk68_6>This will definitely... Whaaaaa!</ScenarioTalk68_6>
    <ScenarioTalk68_7>!?</ScenarioTalk68_7>
    <ScenarioTalk68_8>A very loud explosion shook the village </ScenarioTalk68_8>
    <ScenarioTalk68_9>Err... Well! I was sure this would work out...?</ScenarioTalk68_9>
    <ScenarioTalk68_10>Hmm... Maybe it's because magic stone is not refined.</ScenarioTalk68_10>
    <ScenarioTalk68_11>Whoa! Annie! Are you here to steal my knowledge again!!</ScenarioTalk68_11>
    <ScenarioTalk68_12>No~ I'm just here to see you! Why? Are you being shy?!</ScenarioTalk68_12>
    <ScenarioTalk68_13>Liar! I have no intention of sharing my knowledge with you!</ScenarioTalk68_13>
    <ScenarioTalk68_14>Here! Take this! This will do the magic!</ScenarioTalk68_14>
    <ScenarioTalk68_15>WHA! Don't get too close! We are enemies!!</ScenarioTalk68_15>
    <ScenarioTalk68_16>What~ Where are you going?</ScenarioTalk68_16>
    <ScenarioTalk68_17>... I should first take a look this paper</ScenarioTalk68_17>
    <ScenarioTalk68_18>Someone's coming </ScenarioTalk68_18>
    <ScenarioTalk68_19>Hmm... You were helping Randolph?</ScenarioTalk68_19>
    <ScenarioTalk68_20>Can you let me take a look at Randolph's paper?</ScenarioTalk68_20>
    <ScenarioTalk68_21>Looking at paper, Annie could not resist her laughter and cracked up </ScenarioTalk68_21>
    <ScenarioTalk68_22>Ahh... I knew it! This is typical Randolph!!</ScenarioTalk68_22>
    <ScenarioTalk68_23>With this method, I can't even imagine what kind of result will come!</ScenarioTalk68_23>
    <ScenarioTalk68_24>However, there seem to be some missing information!</ScenarioTalk68_24>
    <ScenarioTalk68_25>Annie took out a pencil from her pocket and began writing something on the paper</ScenarioTalk68_25>
    <ScenarioTalk68_26>This will make it a big easier! Randolph must have forgotten to write down location.</ScenarioTalk68_26>
    <ScenarioTalk68_27>[Herb] written on the paper can be found at Blizzard Mountain...</ScenarioTalk68_27>
    <ScenarioTalk68_28>It's just... You have to defeat boss of the area, [Icetiton] to gain access to herb.</ScenarioTalk68_28>
    <ScenarioTalk68_29>Well~ It should be no problem for someone as powerful as you!</ScenarioTalk68_29>
    <ScenarioTalk68_30>Annie grinned and left</ScenarioTalk68_30>
    
    <ScenarioTalk69_1>As Annie said, let's go to [Blizzard Mountain] to find [Herb]..</ScenarioTalk69_1>
    <ScenarioTalk69_2>It's not that I don't trust Randolph, but I should find it anyway.</ScenarioTalk69_2>
    <ScenarioTalk69_3>Obtained herb from Icetiton! Let's return to Randolph.</ScenarioTalk69_3>
    <ScenarioTalk69_4>Ohhhh! You really did it!!</ScenarioTalk69_4>
    <ScenarioTalk69_5>Great! Now I shall complete this masterpiece!</ScenarioTalk69_5>
    <ScenarioTalk69_6>Randolph began making something with ingredient I brought </ScenarioTalk69_6>
    <ScenarioTalk69_7>?!</ScenarioTalk69_7>
    <ScenarioTalk69_8>A very ordinary thing is on Randolphs hand </ScenarioTalk69_8>
    <ScenarioTalk69_9>This... is a very ordinary....</ScenarioTalk69_9>
    <ScenarioTalk69_10>Wh, what are you talking about! That's right! I have a final request!!</ScenarioTalk69_10>
    <ScenarioTalk69_11>?</ScenarioTalk69_11>
    <ScenarioTalk69_12>Randolph, with an odd grin, began talking. </ScenarioTalk69_12>
    <ScenarioTalk69_13>Anyway! See you at night!!</ScenarioTalk69_13>
    
    <ScenarioTalk70_1>Yes! You're a man of your words! You came as expected!!</ScenarioTalk70_1>
    <ScenarioTalk70_2>This time, it may be a bit difficult... It shouldn't be so hard for you though!</ScenarioTalk70_2>
    <ScenarioTalk70_3>I heard there is an Imp merchant called Aim at Skeleton Fortress.</ScenarioTalk70_3>
    <ScenarioTalk70_4>The Imp has a key ingredient to this perfect invention!</ScenarioTalk70_4>
    <ScenarioTalk70_5>According to rumors, it gives item as prize for winning a card game.</ScenarioTalk70_5>
    <ScenarioTalk70_6>Then! Go get it! I will count on you!</ScenarioTalk70_6>
    <ScenarioTalk70_7>Oh! You're good!!</ScenarioTalk70_7>
    <ScenarioTalk70_8>I wanted to play with you for a bit longer... But it was fun, so no problem!</ScenarioTalk70_8>
    <ScenarioTalk70_9>This is what the big nosed kid asked for. Take it! Uhehee!</ScenarioTalk70_9>
    <ScenarioTalk70_10>Received item requested by Randolph. We should go back to Randolph now.</ScenarioTalk70_10>
    <ScenarioTalk70_11>Randolph smiled at the item and began assembling his invention </ScenarioTalk70_11>
    <ScenarioTalk70_12>Good! It's complete!! She will find this satisfying!</ScenarioTalk70_12>
    <ScenarioTalk70_13>Huh~ Randolph, what are you doing here?</ScenarioTalk70_13>
    <ScenarioTalk70_14>Oh! The heroine is here!! Take this gift from the greatest king of invention in Yutakan!</ScenarioTalk70_14>
    <ScenarioTalk70_15>Randolph handed Annie his invention </ScenarioTalk70_15>
    <ScenarioTalk70_16>A doll?</ScenarioTalk70_16>
    <ScenarioTalk70_17>This is for helping out an experiment before! I always pay back debts!</ScenarioTalk70_17>
    <ScenarioTalk70_18>I heard that Dilis has insomnia....</ScenarioTalk70_18>
    <ScenarioTalk70_19>I asked this gentleman to find herbs that help sleeping and made this doll with it.</ScenarioTalk70_19>
    <ScenarioTalk70_20>I put magic stone in as well, so this doll will help her take long and deep sleep!</ScenarioTalk70_20>
    <ScenarioTalk70_21>So! Now bow down to me and cry tears of gratitude...!</ScenarioTalk70_21>
    <ScenarioTalk70_22>Wh, what! I gave you a gift, and why are you chasing after me!!</ScenarioTalk70_22>
    <ScenarioTalk70_23>That's not it! Please listen to me for a minute!</ScenarioTalk70_23>
    <ScenarioTalk70_24>Randolph is running away from Annie,  and Annie is chasing after Randolph running away.</ScenarioTalk70_24>
    <ScenarioTalk70_25>Sister! What are you doing here! What happened to laboratory!!</ScenarioTalk70_25>
    <ScenarioTalk70_26>Hey! Stop your sister!! She must have gone mental!!</ScenarioTalk70_26>
    <ScenarioTalk70_27>What! Don't you talk like that about my sister!!</ScenarioTalk70_27>
    <ScenarioTalk70_28>This is getting interesting. </ScenarioTalk70_28>
    <ScenarioTalk70_29>Well... Everyone seems happy, so this is good.</ScenarioTalk70_29>
    <ScenarioTalk70_30>Please stop running and come here!!</ScenarioTalk70_30>
    <ScenarioTalk70_31>Ahhh! This is not the ending I wanted!!</ScenarioTalk70_31>
    
    <ScenarioTalk71_1>This laboratory is a mess. What happened here?!</ScenarioTalk71_1>
    <ScenarioTalk71_2>Looking around, I found a familiar face at a corner of the laboratory.</ScenarioTalk71_2>
    <ScenarioTalk71_3>Well... I guess this is not working... out?</ScenarioTalk71_3>
    <ScenarioTalk71_4>A, Annie?</ScenarioTalk71_4>
    <ScenarioTalk71_5>Shh! This is a top secret!! Is there anyone next to you?!</ScenarioTalk71_5>
    <ScenarioTalk71_6>I looked around and shook my head.</ScenarioTalk71_6>
    <ScenarioTalk71_7>Well... It's a long story. This is an invention of lifetime for me!</ScenarioTalk71_7>
    <ScenarioTalk71_8>Lifetime?!</ScenarioTalk71_8>
    <ScenarioTalk71_9>Yes! It is!!</ScenarioTalk71_9>
    <ScenarioTalk71_10>Wh, what! I just heard an explosion here?! Sister!! Where are you!!</ScenarioTalk71_10>
    <ScenarioTalk71_11>Huh? Dilis?! Why do you look so surprised?!</ScenarioTalk71_11>
    <ScenarioTalk71_12>What? Did you hit your head or something? There was an explosion here!!</ScenarioTalk71_12>
    <ScenarioTalk71_13>No... It's just a small explosion during experiment. I'm fine as you can see.</ScenarioTalk71_13>
    <ScenarioTalk71_14>Ah... That's a relief.</ScenarioTalk71_14>
    <ScenarioTalk71_15>But, it's nice to know you care so much about me.</ScenarioTalk71_15>
    <ScenarioTalk71_16>No~ Today, it's your turn to cook! If something happens to you, I have to do it!</ScenarioTalk71_16>
    <ScenarioTalk71_17>Alright, I'm leaving! I will look forward to dinner!</ScenarioTalk71_17>
    <ScenarioTalk71_18>Dilis is...Really honest. Too honest!</ScenarioTalk71_18>
    <ScenarioTalk71_19>...I sense anger in that smile </ScenarioTalk71_19>
    <ScenarioTalk71_20>Ah! Right. You mentioned invention before?</ScenarioTalk71_20>
    <ScenarioTalk71_21>I nodded</ScenarioTalk71_21>
    <ScenarioTalk71_22>...Would you like to work with me?</ScenarioTalk71_22>
    <ScenarioTalk71_23>?</ScenarioTalk71_23>
    <ScenarioTalk71_24>First, take this. Then we should begin moving at night....</ScenarioTalk71_24>
    <ScenarioTalk71_25>Sister! Did you eat the pudding on table?!</ScenarioTalk71_25>
    <ScenarioTalk71_26>Ho...Hohohoho?</ScenarioTalk71_26>
    <ScenarioTalk71_27>Kyaaaaaaak!!</ScenarioTalk71_27>
    <ScenarioTalk71_28>Begin moving at night? Let's get out of here first!</ScenarioTalk71_28>
    
    <ScenarioTalk72_1>I read paper Annie gave me </ScenarioTalk72_1>
    <ScenarioTalk72_2>.......</ScenarioTalk72_2>
    <ScenarioTalk72_3>She has terrible handwriting. I can't read this!</ScenarioTalk72_3>
    <ScenarioTalk72_4>I see... You're here!</ScenarioTalk72_4>
    <ScenarioTalk72_5>That! Is a very important invention to me!</ScenarioTalk72_5>
    <ScenarioTalk72_6>Maybe it will change my destiny! It is an awesome invention!</ScenarioTalk72_6>
    <ScenarioTalk72_7>Destiny?</ScenarioTalk72_7>
    <ScenarioTalk72_8>Anyway, frist mission is to find Rock Powder of Tubaro at Rainbow Lake!</ScenarioTalk72_8>
    <ScenarioTalk72_9>Rock Powder of Tubaro?</ScenarioTalk72_9>
    <ScenarioTalk72_10>Don't worry. I will come with you to collect it. You can concentrate on taking care of monsters nearby!</ScenarioTalk72_10>
    <ScenarioTalk72_11>Isn't it so efficient and simple?</ScenarioTalk72_11>
    <ScenarioTalk72_12>No! It's not simple at all!!</ScenarioTalk72_12>
    <ScenarioTalk72_13>A loud noise echoed in Rainbow Lake</ScenarioTalk72_13>
    <ScenarioTalk72_14>Annie took out a blade... No, a strange looking tool from her pocket</ScenarioTalk72_14>
    <ScenarioTalk72_15>Is it... Is she collecting with that tool?</ScenarioTalk72_15>
    <ScenarioTalk72_16> Good. Then I can just take this much....</ScenarioTalk72_16>
    <ScenarioTalk72_17>Annie put Rock Powder near Tubaro in a small bottle </ScenarioTalk72_17>
    <ScenarioTalk72_18>Good!! Now I have an ingredient!</ScenarioTalk72_18>
    <ScenarioTalk72_19>An ingredient?!</ScenarioTalk72_19>
    <ScenarioTalk72_20>Ok! Let's get moving! We should first leave this Lake!</ScenarioTalk72_20>
    <ScenarioTalk72_21>I see... Trouble... </ScenarioTalk72_21>
    <ScenarioTalk72_22>...We have rock powder now,  then we should find Monkey's Hair!</ScenarioTalk72_22>
    <ScenarioTalk72_23>Monkey's Hair?</ScenarioTalk72_23>
    <ScenarioTalk72_24>Yes! Hair of Cymbalist Monkey!! Ones in Skeleton Fortress!!</ScenarioTalk72_24>
    <ScenarioTalk72_25>.......</ScenarioTalk72_25>
    <ScenarioTalk72_26>What! Why are you looking like that?! I will reward you well!! Let's get going!</ScenarioTalk72_26>
    <ScenarioTalk72_27>This will turn my future pink!!</ScenarioTalk72_27>
    <ScenarioTalk72_28>...Oh man... </ScenarioTalk72_28>
    
    <ScenarioTalk73_1>Alright~! Let's go get Hair of Symbolmonkey at Skeleton Fortress!</ScenarioTalk73_1>
    <ScenarioTalk73_2>This will make my great invention a perfection!</ScenarioTalk73_2>
    <ScenarioTalk73_3>What exactly are you making?</ScenarioTalk73_3>
    <ScenarioTalk73_4>Good! Rock Powder and Monkey's Hair!! Perfect!!</ScenarioTalk73_4>
    <ScenarioTalk73_5>Hurry! I need to go make it! Now my future is pink!</ScenarioTalk73_5>
    <ScenarioTalk73_6>Before I could speak, Annie disappeared </ScenarioTalk73_6>
    <ScenarioTalk73_7>What... could she be making?</ScenarioTalk73_7>
    <ScenarioTalk73_8>Sun is setting, so we should go back too.</ScenarioTalk73_8>
    <ScenarioTalk73_9>What! What have you done to my sister!!</ScenarioTalk73_9>
    <ScenarioTalk73_10>?!</ScenarioTalk73_10>
    <ScenarioTalk73_11>She made a potion and drank it, then her face turned yellow!</ScenarioTalk73_11>
    <ScenarioTalk73_12>She looks so weak as if she's about to die! You two have been going to places lately!!</ScenarioTalk73_12>
    <ScenarioTalk73_13>I will not forgive you if something happens to her!</ScenarioTalk73_13>
    <ScenarioTalk73_14>I calmed down Dilis and headed to laboratory together </ScenarioTalk73_14>
    <ScenarioTalk73_15>Annie is in her bed with her face turned yellow. </ScenarioTalk73_15>
    <ScenarioTalk73_16>She looks very sick... Potion...? Can it be?</ScenarioTalk73_16>
    <ScenarioTalk73_17>Dilis! What happened? What happened to Annie?</ScenarioTalk73_17>
    <ScenarioTalk73_18>Sister... Sister drank a weird potion, then her face...</ScenarioTalk73_18>
    <ScenarioTalk73_19>A complete fool! She really made it and drank it?!</ScenarioTalk73_19>
    <ScenarioTalk73_20>Made...?</ScenarioTalk73_20>
    <ScenarioTalk73_21>Randolph went through lab drawer and found a small memo</ScenarioTalk73_21>
    <ScenarioTalk73_22>Take this memo and find Pong at Skeleton Fortress </ScenarioTalk73_22>
    <ScenarioTalk73_23>I remember that Annie asked Pong to keep a remedy for situations like this!</ScenarioTalk73_23>

    <ScenarioTalk74_1>Annie's life is in danger! Let's go to Skeleton Fortress like Randolph said!</ScenarioTalk74_1>
    <ScenarioTalk74_2>Pong must be waiting for me at Skeleton Fortress!</ScenarioTalk74_2>
    <ScenarioTalk74_3>We should get Annie's remedy from Pong!!</ScenarioTalk74_3>
    <ScenarioTalk74_4>Someone's coming </ScenarioTalk74_4>
    <ScenarioTalk74_5>Heeheeheehee! What! What brings you here?!</ScenarioTalk74_5>
    <ScenarioTalk74_6>I explained to Pong about what happened</ScenarioTalk74_6>
    <ScenarioTalk74_7>Ahah! That's what you're here for!!</ScenarioTalk74_7>
    <ScenarioTalk74_8>Umm... But there's something! When she asked me to keep it, she asked me for something else!!</ScenarioTalk74_8>
    <ScenarioTalk74_9>?!</ScenarioTalk74_9>
    <ScenarioTalk74_10>Ah~ You don't have to be so alarmed! It's like a password!!</ScenarioTalk74_10>
    <ScenarioTalk74_11>You have to answer a few questions! How about that? Keek!! Are you up for it?</ScenarioTalk74_11>
    <ScenarioTalk74_12>I nodded</ScenarioTalk74_12>
    <ScenarioTalk74_13>Is this the remedy Randolph talked about?</ScenarioTalk74_13>
    <ScenarioTalk74_14>Good! Let's take it! </ScenarioTalk74_14>
    <ScenarioTalk74_15>Huh? You got the remedy?!</ScenarioTalk74_15>
    <ScenarioTalk74_16>I heard from Mr. Randolph. However, I think it would be best to hold onto it for now..</ScenarioTalk74_16>
    <ScenarioTalk74_17>It turned out it's only simple stomach ache. According to Ms. Yulia, it's not such big deal.</ScenarioTalk74_17>
    <ScenarioTalk74_18>S, Simple stomach ache?!</ScenarioTalk74_18>
    <ScenarioTalk74_19>She recovered a bit and is now with Mr. Randolph. Come take a look if you are worried..</ScenarioTalk74_19>
    <ScenarioTalk74_20>...!</ScenarioTalk74_20>
    <ScenarioTalk74_21>Still looking a bit sick, Annie is in her bed with a very happy smile. </ScenarioTalk74_21>
    <ScenarioTalk74_22>Next to her is Randolph, peeling fruits looking annoyed. </ScenarioTalk74_22>
    <ScenarioTalk74_23>What happened while we were away for the remedy?</ScenarioTalk74_23>
    <ScenarioTalk74_24>While you went to get the remedy, Mr. Randolph has been taking care of Ms. Annie!</ScenarioTalk74_24>
    <ScenarioTalk74_25>While saying “My rival shouldn't die!" "You can't just die before we settle our rivalry!!"</ScenarioTalk74_25>
    <ScenarioTalk74_26>I asked about Annie's potion </ScenarioTalk74_26>
    <ScenarioTalk74_27>It's dye that turns hair yellow..</ScenarioTalk74_27>
    <ScenarioTalk74_28>It's supposed to be used for hair.... But she drank it! Obviously she would have stomach ache!</ScenarioTalk74_28>
    <ScenarioTalk74_29>Why dye hair yellow..?</ScenarioTalk74_29>
    <ScenarioTalk74_30>Mr. Randolph has a thing for yellow-haired glamor!</ScenarioTalk74_30>
    <ScenarioTalk74_31>Hmm~ Maybe he wanted to meet a beautiful and amazing girl like me?</ScenarioTalk74_31>
    <ScenarioTalk74_32>Ah!... He said he is not interested in brainless women, so you're not it.</ScenarioTalk74_32>
    <ScenarioTalk74_33>What!!</ScenarioTalk74_33>
    <ScenarioTalk74_34>Umm... My sister is a bit weird...!</ScenarioTalk74_34>
    <ScenarioTalk74_35>Dilis is grumbling, and next to her are Jimon and Nuri arguing as always.</ScenarioTalk74_35>
    <ScenarioTalk74_36>Weird and noisy day has ended like that. </ScenarioTalk74_36>

    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_1>What do you need most?</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_1>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_2>What do you want most?</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_2>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_3>?????????</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_3>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success1>Uhehehe! Nice! </ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success1>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success2>Question is a bit weird?!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success2>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success3>Then! Next question!!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success3>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success4>You're doing quite well with such difficult question!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success4>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success5>[Surely, the answer is weird!]</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success5>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success6>Alright! Then next question!!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success6>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success7>Kukeekeekeek! Annie sent you alright!!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success7>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success8>[Why are answers all... Randolph!!!]</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success8>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success9>Here's remedy! Say hello to Annie for me Uhehehe!!!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success9>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success10>Let's... go back to laboratory</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Success10>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Fail1>What! You answered wrong! Liar!!!</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Fail1>
    <ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Fail2>Pong mumbled then disappeared in an instance.</ScenarioTalk74_Quiz_Fail2>
    
    <ScenarioTalk75_1>Why would Mr. Baruss be looking for us so early in the morning?</ScenarioTalk75_1>
    <ScenarioTalk75_2>Umm... It's probably for something messy and difficult... </ScenarioTalk75_2>
    <ScenarioTalk75_3>I,I would like to pass....</ScenarioTalk75_3>
    <ScenarioTalk75_4>Is that person lying on desk... is it?!</ScenarioTalk75_4>
    <ScenarioTalk75_5>Mr. Baruss?!</ScenarioTalk75_5>
    <ScenarioTalk75_6>Mr.  Baruss is collapsed onto his desk.</ScenarioTalk75_6>
    <ScenarioTalk75_7>He's not breathing. Who could have done this?!</ScenarioTalk75_7>
    <ScenarioTalk75_8>Someone with grudges against Mr. Baruss?</ScenarioTalk75_8>
    <ScenarioTalk75_9>Mr. Baruss is... murdered?!</ScenarioTalk75_9>
    <ScenarioTalk75_10>Who could have done this?! Such evil doing...!</ScenarioTalk75_10>
    <ScenarioTalk75_11>Ummm...? What are you talking about? I'm fine!</ScenarioTalk75_11>
    <ScenarioTalk75_12>Whooooaaa!!!</ScenarioTalk75_12>
    <ScenarioTalk75_13>Hahaha! I'm sorry. I must have been so exhausted that I lost consciousness..</ScenarioTalk75_13>
    <ScenarioTalk75_14>Y... You fell asleep?</ScenarioTalk75_14>
    <ScenarioTalk75_15>I've never seen anyone sleep like corpse before!</ScenarioTalk75_15>
    <ScenarioTalk75_16>Huhuhuh! I'm a bit pleased to see you worry so much about me!</ScenarioTalk75_16>
    <ScenarioTalk75_17>Anyway... You must be here because you received my call?</ScenarioTalk75_17>
    <ScenarioTalk75_18>Yes! Did you not call us about an urgent matter?</ScenarioTalk75_18>
    <ScenarioTalk75_19>That's right! Your job is simple! I would like to know meaning of a few words!.</ScenarioTalk75_19>
    <ScenarioTalk75_20>Meaning of words?</ScenarioTalk75_20>
    <ScenarioTalk75_21>You haven't learned words until your age? You must have been a very lazy student!</ScenarioTalk75_21>
    <ScenarioTalk75_22>Wh, what are you talking about! If you can't trust me, take a look at these characters!</ScenarioTalk75_22>
    <ScenarioTalk75_23>Baruss showed us a book with writings that are very difficult to recognize.</ScenarioTalk75_23>
    <ScenarioTalk75_24>Umm... These writings are in fact very difficult to read,</ScenarioTalk75_24>
    <ScenarioTalk75_25>What! I've never seen word like this!! Reading this is impossible!</ScenarioTalk75_25>
    <ScenarioTalk75_26>Exactly! That's what I'm talking about!!</ScenarioTalk75_26>
    <ScenarioTalk75_27>So~ If you find out what these words mean, I will give you plenty of reward!</ScenarioTalk75_27>
    <ScenarioTalk75_28>Ohoh! Since you're mayor of this village, will you give us treasure></ScenarioTalk75_28>
    <ScenarioTalk75_29>I, I would like 10 year worth of food!</ScenarioTalk75_29>
    <ScenarioTalk75_30>No! Do you think I'm Santa or something? Find these words! Hurry!! </ScenarioTalk75_30>
    <ScenarioTalk75_31>Word research... Who would know about such weird characters?</ScenarioTalk75_31>

    <ScenarioTalk76_1>Hmm... Who would know about this paper?</ScenarioTalk76_1>
    <ScenarioTalk76_2>What is this rag?</ScenarioTalk76_2>
    <ScenarioTalk76_3>Mr. Baruss is requesting? I see....</ScenarioTalk76_3>
    <ScenarioTalk76_4>Randolph began looking and turning the paper around. </ScenarioTalk76_4>
    <ScenarioTalk76_5>...I have no idea what this writing means!! I...It isn't my specialty!</ScenarioTalk76_5>
    <ScenarioTalk76_6>This isn't a pleasant statement... But Annie may know something..</ScenarioTalk76_6>
    <ScenarioTalk76_7>Go talk to Annie! She's great with things like this!.</ScenarioTalk76_7>
    <ScenarioTalk76_8>...Annie might know something</ScenarioTalk76_8>
    <ScenarioTalk76_9>Hmm... What is it? What ! It looks too annoying!!</ScenarioTalk76_9>
    <ScenarioTalk76_10>If you figure this out, Mr. Randolph will spend time with you!</ScenarioTalk76_10>
    <ScenarioTalk76_11>Th, these characters are ancient rune characters! Ms. Yulia probably would know well about them!!</ScenarioTalk76_11>
    <ScenarioTalk76_12>[Her response is too fast]</ScenarioTalk76_12>
    <ScenarioTalk76_13>[Before that, you lied!]</ScenarioTalk76_13>
    <ScenarioTalk76_14>Then let's go to Ms. Yulia!!</ScenarioTalk76_14>
    <ScenarioTalk76_15>Wh, what are you doing! What on earth is this!</ScenarioTalk76_15>
    <ScenarioTalk76_16>Did you so want to spend time with me?! Really? Really???</ScenarioTalk76_16>
    <ScenarioTalk76_17>There must have been a mistake! Hey! Nuri! Jimon!! Stop right there!!!</ScenarioTalk76_17>
    <ScenarioTalk76_18>Leaving screaming Randolph behind, we headed to meet Yulia </ScenarioTalk76_18>
    <ScenarioTalk76_19>That's right. Yulia would know something!</ScenarioTalk76_19>
    <ScenarioTalk76_20>Hmm? These characters... These are written in language of Light Priests</ScenarioTalk76_20>
    <ScenarioTalk76_21>Whoa! I knew you would know! Can you translate them as well?</ScenarioTalk76_21>
    <ScenarioTalk76_22>If we find out meaning of these characters, Mr. Baruss promised us big reward....</ScenarioTalk76_22>
    <ScenarioTalk76_23>I would love to translate them for you... However, I have patrol duty today....</ScenarioTalk76_23>
    <ScenarioTalk76_24>Patrol duty! How about we take care of Ms. Yulia's work?</ScenarioTalk76_24>
    <ScenarioTalk76_25>Well~ Patrol isn't so hard.</ScenarioTalk76_25>
    <ScenarioTalk76_26>Thank you. Please follow Mr. Kanggalo's lead to head outside this village..</ScenarioTalk76_26>
    <ScenarioTalk76_27>While you take care of patrol duty, I will translate these characters.</ScenarioTalk76_27>

    <ScenarioTalk77_1>What?! Why are you here instead of Ms. Yulia???</ScenarioTalk77_1>
    <ScenarioTalk77_2>What! It's not like there is problem because we are here instead of her!!</ScenarioTalk77_2>
    <ScenarioTalk77_3>Ah~ You must be interested in her!</ScenarioTalk77_3>
    <ScenarioTalk77_4>N...Nonsense! Who do you think I am!</ScenarioTalk77_4>
    <ScenarioTalk77_5>Hmm... But since you're powerful, I can give you tough job rather than easy ones!</ScenarioTalk77_5>
    <ScenarioTalk77_6>Why! This is unfair!!</ScenarioTalk77_6>
    <ScenarioTalk77_7>What! Then go back and bring Ms. Yulia here! I prefer that!!</ScenarioTalk77_7>
    <ScenarioTalk77_8>We can see what you want, Mr. Kanggalo....</ScenarioTalk77_8>
    <ScenarioTalk77_9>Then defeat [Demon Shelter] at [Underwater Cave] [2] time!</ScenarioTalk77_9>
    <ScenarioTalk77_10>It's invading this village recently!! </ScenarioTalk77_10>
    <ScenarioTalk77_11>Why are you always giving us hard jobs?</ScenarioTalk77_11>
    <ScenarioTalk77_12>Maybe because you're ugly?</ScenarioTalk77_12>
    <ScenarioTalk77_13>What!!</ScenarioTalk77_13>
    <ScenarioTalk77_14>Alright! Now that we have defeated Demon Shelter, let's head back to village</ScenarioTalk77_14>
    <ScenarioTalk77_15>We should go to Ms. Yulia!</ScenarioTalk77_15>
    <ScenarioTalk77_16>I've been waiting for you. All the words have been translated.</ScenarioTalk77_16>
    <ScenarioTalk77_17>However, some words are still unclear.</ScenarioTalk77_17>
    <ScenarioTalk77_18>Unclear? You mean they are not translated properly?</ScenarioTalk77_18>
    <ScenarioTalk77_19>No... It's more that the words have too many meanings to translate them easily.</ScenarioTalk77_19>
    <ScenarioTalk77_20>Maybe this is like password.</ScenarioTalk77_20>
    <ScenarioTalk77_21>It's similar. What's written at the end of Mr. Baruss's paper...</ScenarioTalk77_21>
    <ScenarioTalk77_22>"Records of light will stay and bring good fortume" refers to a certain item that contains certain information.</ScenarioTalk77_22>
    <ScenarioTalk77_23>Item...? Then this paper leads to hiding place of certain item?</ScenarioTalk77_23>
    <ScenarioTalk77_24>Yulia smiled hearing Nuri's question, then nodded. </ScenarioTalk77_24>
    <ScenarioTalk77_25>That's right. Combing these words, we can deduct that this paper leads us to Tower of Light!</ScenarioTalk77_25>
    <ScenarioTalk77_26>Please find “Item that contains records of light” at Tower of Light.</ScenarioTalk77_26>
    <ScenarioTalk77_27>Something's recorded... And is ancient? A stone tablet?!</ScenarioTalk77_27>
    <ScenarioTalk77_28>We'll find out! Let's go to Tower of Light!!</ScenarioTalk77_28>
    
    <ScenarioTalk78_1>Ms. Yulia definitely told us to go to Tower of light!!</ScenarioTalk78_1>
    <ScenarioTalk78_2>Good! Now I can see the end coming! Let's go to Tower of Light!</ScenarioTalk78_2>
    <ScenarioTalk78_3>There's strange feeling around here... It must be nearby!</ScenarioTalk78_3>
    <ScenarioTalk78_4>Is this the stone tablet?</ScenarioTalk78_4>
    <ScenarioTalk78_5>What are you doing standing around!! Take out the magic stone!</ScenarioTalk78_5>
    <ScenarioTalk78_6>I took out magic stone from my bag and placed it on Tablet of Light </ScenarioTalk78_6>
    <ScenarioTalk78_7>Mysterious blue light shines on Tablet of Light</ScenarioTalk78_7>
    <ScenarioTalk78_8>Magic Stone may show us hidden information on this tablet!</ScenarioTalk78_8>
    <ScenarioTalk78_9>Be careful! If we fail, we need to get magic stone again!</ScenarioTalk78_9>
    <ScenarioTalk78_10>Bright light exploded from Tablet of Light </ScenarioTalk78_10>
    <ScenarioTalk78_11>??</ScenarioTalk78_11>
    <ScenarioTalk78_12>!!!</ScenarioTalk78_12>
    <ScenarioTalk78_13>Are you alright?</ScenarioTalk78_13>
    <ScenarioTalk78_14>Huh? We were at Tower of Light...</ScenarioTalk78_14>
    <ScenarioTalk78_15>Wh, what happened? </ScenarioTalk78_15>
    <ScenarioTalk78_16>I went by Tower of Light just to make sure, and you were lying there.</ScenarioTalk78_16>
    <ScenarioTalk78_17>Tablet of Light probably defended itself from intruders and teleported you out.</ScenarioTalk78_17>
    <ScenarioTalk78_18>Then... Did we return without anything?</ScenarioTalk78_18>
    <ScenarioTalk78_19>Do you think so?</ScenarioTalk78_19>
    <ScenarioTalk78_20>Yulia grinned and handed me Baruss's paper </ScenarioTalk78_20>
    <ScenarioTalk78_21>It is now filled with strange characters that wer enot there </ScenarioTalk78_21>
    <ScenarioTalk78_22>What is this?!</ScenarioTalk78_22>
    <ScenarioTalk78_23>It is lineage of Amorru, God of Light Priests, that was not known to non-experts.</ScenarioTalk78_23>
    <ScenarioTalk78_24>Wow... There are names of different gods other than Amorru!</ScenarioTalk78_24>
    <ScenarioTalk78_25>God of light and creation, Amorru. God nowhere to be found. </ScenarioTalk78_25>
    <ScenarioTalk78_26>Five Dersa, followers of light... Daiz, god of destiny, Sands, goddess of sleep...</ScenarioTalk78_26>
    <ScenarioTalk78_27>Gudra, god of space, Ginu, goddess of time, Ezanok, god of memory...?</ScenarioTalk78_27>
    <ScenarioTalk78_28>Whoa! Then we made a great discovery?!</ScenarioTalk78_28>
    <ScenarioTalk78_29>That's right! Priests of Light would thank us!</ScenarioTalk78_29>
    <ScenarioTalk78_30>Actually... That is...</ScenarioTalk78_30>
    <ScenarioTalk78_31>This lineage of gods have been found by scholars long ago.</ScenarioTalk78_31>
    <ScenarioTalk78_32>Coming to think of it, Mr. Baruss requested about it a little while ago and I gave this to him...</ScenarioTalk78_32>
    <ScenarioTalk78_33>Mr. Baruss must have forgotten... And must have requested to you again..</ScenarioTalk78_33>
    <ScenarioTalk78_34>.......</ScenarioTalk78_34>
    <ScenarioTalk78_35>.......</ScenarioTalk78_35>
    <ScenarioTalk78_36>.......</ScenarioTalk78_36>
    <ScenarioTalk78_37>Ohoh! So you found out about the words! Tell me!</ScenarioTalk78_37>
    <ScenarioTalk78_38>I asked Baruss why he wants to know about the words. </ScenarioTalk78_38>
    <ScenarioTalk78_39>Ah... Did I not tell you? It is for a date with a granny next village...</ScenarioTalk78_39>
    <ScenarioTalk78_40>Hmm? Nuri? Jimon? Even you... W...Wait!!!</ScenarioTalk78_40>
    <ScenarioTalk78_41>Be nice to old people! Be nice to old people! Help!!!</ScenarioTalk78_41>
    <ScenarioTalk78_42>Mr. Baruss is said to have sustained a lengthy injury from beating.</ScenarioTalk78_42>
    <ScenarioTalk78_43>Of course, main attacker were... enraged Nuri and Jimon...</ScenarioTalk78_43>

    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success1>Stone Tablet of Light began shining more brightly than before </ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success1>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success2>Ohoh! It seems different!!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success2>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success3>Alright! Let's concentrate on recovering it a bit more!!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success3>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success4>There's clear writing on Stone Tablet of Light</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success4>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success5>Whoa! I see writing on it!! </ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success5>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success6>Just a bit more! We're almost there!!!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Success6>

    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail1>Recovery failed!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail1>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail2>Stone Tablet of Light began emitting bright light</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail2>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail3>What! What's this!!!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail3>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail4>I know this... I've seen something like this before!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail4>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail5>We were expelled from Tower of Light after failing recovery process</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail5>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail6>Argh... Recovering Stone Tablet of Light is more difficult than expected!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail6>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail7>We should be more careful with this!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail7>
    <ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail8>Alright! Let's go back to [Tower of Light] again and try harder!</ScenarioTalk78_Mini_Fail8>
    
    <!--시즌2-->
    <!-- 루미니 1막 -->
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 0 -->
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_1>What…I've been looking all over for you and you were here?!</ScenarioTalk79_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_2>Romini suddenly gave me a piece of paper</ScenarioTalk79_1_2>
    
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_3>?</ScenarioTalk79_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_4>I would like you to obtain these immediately</ScenarioTalk79_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_5>I'll explain later. Please hurry!</ScenarioTalk79_1_5>
    
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_6>Romini disappeared even before I asked for the reason</ScenarioTalk79_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_7>He looked pretty busy...Let's ask for the reason later.</ScenarioTalk79_1_7>
    
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_8>First…it says to obtain [Herb] at [Tomb of Forest God]</ScenarioTalk79_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_9>But "This [Herb] loses its effect during daytime…</ScenarioTalk79_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_10>so it can only be obtained during night time."</ScenarioTalk79_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk79_1_11>It seems difficult but let's get going.</ScenarioTalk79_1_11>
    
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 1 -->
    
    <ScenarioTalk79_2_1>Did you find the herb?!</ScenarioTalk79_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk79_2_2>When I gave Romini the herb Romini put the herb in his bag</ScenarioTalk79_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk79_2_3>Well OK I'll be going now! See you again later!</ScenarioTalk79_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk79_2_4>Romini went off to somewhere in a hurry</ScenarioTalk79_2_4>
    
    <!-- 루미니 2막 -->
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 0 -->
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_1>Hey you! Did you get the herb properly?!</ScenarioTalk80_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_2>Romini was furious when he saw me and started to quibble over it</ScenarioTalk80_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_3>I've told Romini I got the herb according to the prescribtion he gave me.</ScenarioTalk80_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_4>…Is that true. Then this information was incorrect as well</ScenarioTalk80_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_5>I asked Romini why he neeed the herb.</ScenarioTalk80_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_6>Romini was hesitant so a moment and then spoke</ScenarioTalk80_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_7>It..its none of your business! Don't start asking me these questions</ScenarioTalk80_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_8>Anyway! I…I will repay you later! Lend me some gold!</ScenarioTalk80_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_9>When I took out gold from my pocket Romini took the gold and went off in a hurry</ScenarioTalk80_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_10>What is happening…I will need to find out what the reason is</ScenarioTalk80_1_10>
    
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_11>Oh~ What's up! What brings you this late at night!</ScenarioTalk80_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_12>Huh? What's up with that expression? Did something happen…?</ScenarioTalk80_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_13>I've told Pino about meeting up with Romini</ScenarioTalk80_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_14>Hmm…It may seem to be "that" might be the reason. There is only one reason why Romini will act that way.</ScenarioTalk80_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_15>Reason?</ScenarioTalk80_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_16>Romini lost his parents to monsters when he was young. You know that right?</ScenarioTalk80_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_17>I nodded.</ScenarioTalk80_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_18>Ever since Romini took care of his younger sister, his only remaining family</ScenarioTalk80_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_19>Maybe…It might be related to the rumor that his sister became sick recently</ScenarioTalk80_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_20>Anyway would you show me Romini's prescription you were speaking about earlier?</ScenarioTalk80_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_21>I handed the prescription that Romini gave me to Pino</ScenarioTalk80_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_22>….Hmm</ScenarioTalk80_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_23>This is rubbish! The herb in here is a posinous herb!</ScenarioTalk80_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_24>!?</ScenarioTalk80_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_25>Romini must have bought this from a faulty tradesman with his gold</ScenarioTalk80_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_26>Even that bright Romini makes this mistake because his sister is sick….Oh well</ScenarioTalk80_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_27>I'll help you a little! It might a little dangerous..but can you do it?</ScenarioTalk80_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_28>I told her it's OK</ScenarioTalk80_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_29>You are still sweet as ever. Alright! I'll rewrite the prescription!</ScenarioTalk80_1_29>
    
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_30>Here! Here's the new prescription. Romini's sister will recover with this</ScenarioTalk80_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_31>It might be a little difficult but there is also a [Herb] that blooms at [Night] in the [Wind Temple]</ScenarioTalk80_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_32>That [Herb] will help detoxify Romini's sister..because the prescription from earlier is a poisonous herb</ScenarioTalk80_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_33>!?</ScenarioTalk80_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_34>Romini disappearing after being overwhelmed is the proof</ScenarioTalk80_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk80_1_35>Then please go get it! I'll prepare to turn the herb into medicine in the meanwhile!</ScenarioTalk80_1_35>
    
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 1 -->
    
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_1>Hey! I've been waiting! So did you find the herb?</ScenarioTalk80_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_2>I handed the herb to Pino</ScenarioTalk80_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_3>Ms. Yuria please do me a favor! I'll go and get Romini</ScenarioTalk80_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_4>Mmm…It’s a rare herb. It's not very complicated so I'll be able to make the medicine soon</ScenarioTalk80_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_5>Please wait! I'll make the medicine soon</ScenarioTalk80_2_5>
    
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_6>Fortunately the herb blended very well. Thanks for your effort.</ScenarioTalk80_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_7>I smiled and nodded</ScenarioTalk80_2_7>
    
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_8>Good heavens! Something has gone wrong!</ScenarioTalk80_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_9>?</ScenarioTalk80_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_10>That foolish boy! It seems like he asked about the herb belatedly and went to the [Wind Temple] alone!</ScenarioTalk80_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_11>Terrible monsters will be roaming at night!</ScenarioTalk80_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_12>Romini's life might be in danger!</ScenarioTalk80_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_13>Please! Go find that idiot at [Wind Temple]!</ScenarioTalk80_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk80_2_14>I hurried to the [Wind temple]</ScenarioTalk80_2_14>
    
    <!-- 루미니 3막 -->
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 0 -->
    <ScenarioTalk81_1_1>Let's hurry to [Wind Temple] to find Romini</ScenarioTalk81_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk81_1_2>We cannot guarentee Romini's safety if he went to [Wind Temple] alone!</ScenarioTalk81_1_2>
    
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 1 -->
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_1>I heard someone's breath around here somewhere</ScenarioTalk81_2_1>
    
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_2>I found Romini lying on the floor in a corner!</ScenarioTalk81_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_3>He must have collapsed out of exhaustion. We need to hurry back to the village with Romini</ScenarioTalk81_2_3>
    
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_4>Going alone to the [Wind Temple] alone! Are you out of your mind?! </ScenarioTalk81_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_5>Sorry…</ScenarioTalk81_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_6>What would have happened if this fellow didn't go rescue you!</ScenarioTalk81_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_7>…….</ScenarioTalk81_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_8>I told Pino to calm down.</ScenarioTalk81_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_9>…….</ScenarioTalk81_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_10>Alright…Let's first give your sister the medicine. This fellow went through all the trouble to get it.</ScenarioTalk81_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_11>…He did?</ScenarioTalk81_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_12>What do mean by that! Say that you are thankful!</ScenarioTalk81_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_13>Th..Thank you!</ScenarioTalk81_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_14>What are you doing! Hurry up and give your sister the medicine!</ScenarioTalk81_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_15>Romini nodded and quickly disappeared into the house</ScenarioTalk81_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_16>…That was a pretty harsh lesson</ScenarioTalk81_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_17>Well…It was a lesson he needed. It becomes a problem when you are too stubborn!</ScenarioTalk81_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_18>It's also a "whip of love" out of concern right?</ScenarioTalk81_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_19>Humph!</ScenarioTalk81_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_20>Why don't you…take a peek?</ScenarioTalk81_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_21>?</ScenarioTalk81_2_21>
    
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_22>I could see Romini with a bright smile for the first time</ScenarioTalk81_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_23>His sister must be invaluable to him as much as the time he spent together after he lost his parents.</ScenarioTalk81_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_24>Look. Doesn't Ms.Pino expression look like a mother's expression?</ScenarioTalk81_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_25>I silently looked at Pino at Yuria's words</ScenarioTalk81_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_26>Wh..what! Why are you staring at someone's face like that!</ScenarioTalk81_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_27>I smiled with Yuria while looking at Pino</ScenarioTalk81_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_28>D..don't snicker at someone's face while you're looking at it! Both of you!</ScenarioTalk81_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_29>It was a difficult and troublesome job but the Romini's smile relieved me of my exhaustion.</ScenarioTalk81_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_30>Being someone's aid must always be a gret joy</ScenarioTalk81_2_30>
    
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_31>I hear someone's footsteps. Romini?!</ScenarioTalk81_2_31>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_32>Sorry about earlier on…I was too greedy</ScenarioTalk81_2_32>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_33>Romini was hesitant but then lower his head and spoke.</ScenarioTalk81_2_33>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_34>I fo..formally applogize…for my rude behavior!</ScenarioTalk81_2_34>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_35>I told Romini it didn't mater</ScenarioTalk81_2_35>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_36>No! I cannot live with owing a debt to somebody</ScenarioTalk81_2_36>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_37>Please! Take this!!</ScenarioTalk81_2_37>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_38>Is this [Dersa's Blessing]? You're giving something this rare?</ScenarioTalk81_2_38>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_39>No…now we're even! I'll see you tomorrow!</ScenarioTalk81_2_39>
    <ScenarioTalk81_2_40>He still seems like a kid who is poor at showing his emotions</ScenarioTalk81_2_40>

    <ScenarioTalk82_1_1>Today's weather seems very good. I think I also had a nice dream last night</ScenarioTalk82_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk82_1_2>Maybe we'll find something good, so should we explore the Forest of Hope a little bit?</ScenarioTalk82_1_2>
    
    <!-- 서브퀘스트 1-->
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_1>Hm? Isn't this an Egg Dragon's Egg Fragment?</ScenarioTalk82_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_2>I said I found it in the Forest of Hope by chance</ScenarioTalk82_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_3>Well… a fully grown Egg Dragon leaves it behind occasionally</ScenarioTalk82_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_4>….</ScenarioTalk82_2_4>
    
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_5>Oh! You're all here! What were you talking about without me!</ScenarioTalk82_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_6>We were just looking at this Egg Dragon's Egg Fragment.</ScenarioTalk82_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_7>Hmm it's an ordinary Egg Dragon's Egg Fragment? What about it?!</ScenarioTalk82_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_8>…….</ScenarioTalk82_2_8>
    
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_9>Jimon suddenly got angry and dissapeared</ScenarioTalk82_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_10>Well…he didn't notice did he?</ScenarioTalk82_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_11>Hey! If you're not busy will you help me?</ScenarioTalk82_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_12>?</ScenarioTalk82_2_12>
    
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_13>Ah~ sorry sorry! I didn't explain enough?!</ScenarioTalk82_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_14>Um…So today is a day that is like Jimon's birthday</ScenarioTalk82_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_15>A day like his birthday?</ScenarioTalk82_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_16>Well it’s a long story…are you willing to listen to it?</ScenarioTalk82_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_17>I nodded my head</ScenarioTalk82_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_18>You still have a nice heart</ScenarioTalk82_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_19>?</ScenarioTalk82_2_19>
    
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_20>Jimon was abandoned by his parents when he was young</ScenarioTalk82_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_21>Or…they were killed by someone before he was born</ScenarioTalk82_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_22>So he was an outcast in the Egg Dragon group probably because of that</ScenarioTalk82_2_22>
    
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_23>Today is actually not his birthday but the day Jimon and I met!</ScenarioTalk82_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_24>Back then…Jimon was abandoned and lying on the forest floor</ScenarioTalk82_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_25>He was greatly wounded and didn't want to befriend anybody</ScenarioTalk82_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_26>Well! But he is close with us now! So no worries!</ScenarioTalk82_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_27>There seems to be no lies in Nuri's smile</ScenarioTalk82_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_28>Oh right! So….I'm thinking about having a surprise party for Jimon!</ScenarioTalk82_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk82_2_29>Please take this note! Make sure you read it where nobody sees you!</ScenarioTalk82_2_29>

    <ScenarioTalk84_2_3>Jimon will be pleased with this amount of Goga</ScenarioTalk84_2_3>

    <ScenarioTalk88_1_5>Nuri!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_6>S..so what's the business?</ScenarioTalk88_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_7>Simple~ Let's knock the wind out of that stupid pupil of mine</ScenarioTalk88_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_8>I want to prove the results for years of my research to the world</ScenarioTalk88_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_9>My research will be a historical record for dragon research!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_10>It maybe the salvation for the world's crisis!</ScenarioTalk88_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_11>Crisis? What do you mean?!</ScenarioTalk88_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_12>It’s better to experience first-hand rather than me explaining!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_13>Go to the Wrecked Ship! Then you will see what I mean!</ScenarioTalk88_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_14>I hurried to the Wrecked Ship</ScenarioTalk88_1_14>
    
    
    <!-- 모의 전투이후 -->
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_15>That's strange..? Why did the old man tell me to come here?</ScenarioTalk88_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_16>He seems to have something in mind so let's search more!</ScenarioTalk88_1_16>
    
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_17>Wh.what is that!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_18>I feel a power different than usual!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_19>The surroundings are strange! Something feels odd!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_20>There is nowhere to run! Let's defeat it first!</ScenarioTalk88_1_20>
    
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_21>…Too strong!</ScenarioTalk88_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_22>뭐야 이 자식! 어디서 저런 힘을?!</ScenarioTalk88_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_23>You're in trouble as I thought!</ScenarioTalk88_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_24>Mamo Ruddik?!</ScenarioTalk88_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_25>Here~! Take this!</ScenarioTalk88_1_25>
    
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_26>Now! Everybody run!!</ScenarioTalk88_1_26>
    
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_27>What was that! Were you trying to kill us?!</ScenarioTalk88_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_28>If there was a strong monster like that isn't it normal that you warn us in advance?</ScenarioTalk88_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_29>Hahahat! Thank you for your overwhelming response!</ScenarioTalk88_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_30>Wh..what?!</ScenarioTalk88_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_31>Well you should have felt it for yourself now.</ScenarioTalk88_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_32>Didn't you receive a strange feeling while you were facing the monsters?</ScenarioTalk88_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_33>Now that you mention it…the surroundings changed.</ScenarioTalk88_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_34>Something like a black aura was coming from the monster's body…?</ScenarioTalk88_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_35>Yes! That was the phenomenon I was studying for decades.</ScenarioTalk88_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_36>It's called the Origin of Darkness</ScenarioTalk88_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_37>Origin of Darkness?</ScenarioTalk88_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_38>Kades, the God of Darkness, is a being beyond our imagination</ScenarioTalk88_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_39>Kades is continuing his effort to resurrect himself even now.</ScenarioTalk88_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_40>One of those phenomenon is the "Origin of Darkness".</ScenarioTalk88_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_41>This power is one of the cures of Kades and can give a monster enormous power.</ScenarioTalk88_1_41>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_42>Now look over there! The place you've escaped is actually called [Area of Kades]</ScenarioTalk88_1_42>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_43>Wha…what's that?! An unpleasant symbol appeared!</ScenarioTalk88_1_43>
    <ScenarioTalk88_1_44>That symbol…is that the Symbol of Kades?!</ScenarioTalk88_1_44>
    
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_1>Wow~ that gloomy cloud disappeared! I feel energized!</ScenarioTalk88_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_2>Well~ now you've experienced enough of Area of Kades I presume?</ScenarioTalk88_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_3>The [Area of Kades] you've experienced is a magical area created by the Disciples of Black Robe!</ScenarioTalk88_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_4>The monsters there are stronger than you imagine due to the magical powers they receive</ScenarioTalk88_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_5>They are trapped inside the [Area of Kades] created by the Black Robes, so there is no harm to Elpis at the moment…</ScenarioTalk88_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_6>But if the number of monsters grow the area might enlarge and invade Elpis!!</ScenarioTalk88_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_7>I..if monster strong as these go to Elpis…</ScenarioTalk88_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_8>The villagers will be seriously wounded!</ScenarioTalk88_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_9>That's right! But there is a way to neutralize to the curse's power!!</ScenarioTalk88_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_10>That's Dragon [Awakening]! It is also the goal of my research!</ScenarioTalk88_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_11>Go inside the [Area of Kades] after your dragon has gone through [Awakening] </ScenarioTalk88_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_12>defeat the monster steadily~ and there will be no worries about the invasion!</ScenarioTalk88_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_13>…I have feeling that we're being tricked as this goes on</ScenarioTalk88_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_14>Maybe…he is more of a fraud than a magic-engineer</ScenarioTalk88_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_15>…….</ScenarioTalk88_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_16>Wh..what! What's with that suspicious glance! A..Anyway!!</ScenarioTalk88_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_17>Now that you have enough motive! You need to help me out more!!</ScenarioTalk88_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk88_2_18>The proof of my research! You will obtain the power to save the world with Dragon [Awakening]</ScenarioTalk88_2_18>

    <ScenarioTalk89_1_1>I told Annie about what I've experienced</ScenarioTalk89_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_2>…Origin of Darkness. I have certainly heard about that.</ScenarioTalk89_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_3>A supernatural phenomenon caused by the power of Kades.</ScenarioTalk89_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_4>But I didn't know that phenomenon happened in Yutakan as well.</ScenarioTalk89_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_5>I hate to admit it, but this time that old weasel is..</ScenarioTalk89_1_5>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_6>인Is correct and we should help! That's what you’re trying to say right?!</ScenarioTalk89_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_7>…….</ScenarioTalk89_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_8>Well~I do have a certain playful side but I am serious this time!</ScenarioTalk89_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_9>…You mean unpredicable to level of craziness not playful</ScenarioTalk89_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_10>Whi..whichever! I'll take that as a complement from my lovely pupil!!</ScenarioTalk89_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_11>Tsk…!</ScenarioTalk89_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_12>So~ The thing I'll give you this time is this!</ScenarioTalk89_1_12>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_13>This is?</ScenarioTalk89_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_14>It seems like a map made out of magic-engineering</ScenarioTalk89_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_15>Yes~Incredible! My best pupil Annie!</ScenarioTalk89_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_16>This is a magic-engineering map powered by the power of [Magic Stone]</ScenarioTalk89_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_17>If you activate this map you can the find the alleged island of fear!</ScenarioTalk89_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_18>The island of fear….W..wait! Master! You don't mean?!</ScenarioTalk89_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_19>That's right! It’s the map showing the island of fear, [Uno]!!</ScenarioTalk89_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_20>That island is a forbidden place that no one knows about!</ScenarioTalk89_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_21>Also! What do you know what's there!!</ScenarioTalk89_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_22>No, this place clearly has [Anima] and [Bonheur]!!</ScenarioTalk89_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_23>[Anima] and [Bonheur]?</ScenarioTalk89_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_24>It’s the mysterious material that causes the [Awakening] of dragons!</ScenarioTalk89_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_25>Well~then! I need to go finish rest of my works so later!</ScenarioTalk89_1_25>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_26>…I feel reluctant but it probably isn't a lie.</ScenarioTalk89_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_27>But…It will probably be a dangerous job so be prepared.</ScenarioTalk89_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_28>I nodded at Annie's words.</ScenarioTalk89_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_29>Nuri and Jimon should go along to help.</ScenarioTalk89_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_30>Let's go tell about this to the two of them.</ScenarioTalk89_1_30>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_31>Let's go tell about this to the two of them.</ScenarioTalk89_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_32>And that map is the map that shows the island [Uno]…!</ScenarioTalk89_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_33>Then let's go look for the [Magic Stone] in [UnderWater Cave].</ScenarioTalk89_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk89_1_34>Feels like something fun is about to happen?!</ScenarioTalk89_1_34>
    
    <!--마모루딕3막-->
    <!--서브퀘스트1-->
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_1>Now that we have the Magic Stone…We should be able to view the map right?</ScenarioTalk89_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_2>Well…if that old chap isn't a liar.</ScenarioTalk89_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_3>The map reacted to the magic stone and started to shine</ScenarioTalk89_2_3>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_4>The once blank map started show images and letters</ScenarioTalk89_2_4>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_5>Impressive…you really restored the map!</ScenarioTalk89_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_6>What! Why do you show up now!!</ScenarioTalk89_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_7>Can you…decipher this map?</ScenarioTalk89_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_8>It's not difficult. I'll decipher it for you now!</ScenarioTalk89_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_9>The restoration is complete!  Now it's all up to you guys!!</ScenarioTalk89_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_10>What have you done…to tell the rest is up to us?</ScenarioTalk89_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_11>Hahaha…Obviously recovering [Anima] and [Bonheur] from [Uno].</ScenarioTalk89_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_12>Since you're complaining so much…This time I'll join you!</ScenarioTalk89_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_13>Of course I won't be any help in combat. Hohoho!</ScenarioTalk89_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_14>Alright! First let's go to this island [Uno]!</ScenarioTalk89_2_14>
    
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_15>Huh...What's this note on the table?</ScenarioTalk89_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_16>…….</ScenarioTalk89_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_17>This is mater's…</ScenarioTalk89_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk89_2_18>…It can't be. This formula is incorrect!</ScenarioTalk89_2_18>
    
    <!--마모루딕4막-->
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_1>Alright! We finally arrived at the island!</ScenarioTalk90_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_2>I'll knock the wind out of them with my grand research!</ScenarioTalk90_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_3>That old man seems to be very energetic doesn't he?</ScenarioTalk90_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_4>Maybe there was something in the past that happened?</ScenarioTalk90_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_5>Such as…?</ScenarioTalk90_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_6>Recovering his honor?</ScenarioTalk90_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_7>Hurry up! We need to go to the [Black Island] now!</ScenarioTalk90_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_8>We hurried alongside the excited Mamo Ruddik</ScenarioTalk90_1_8>
    
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_9>Mamo Ruddik seems to be searching for something very hard.</ScenarioTalk90_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_10>That old man…he's very passionate.</ScenarioTalk90_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_11>He's looking for it harder than we are isn't he?</ScenarioTalk90_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_12>I..I found it! Its [Bonheur] and [Anima]!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_13>What's that?!</ScenarioTalk90_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_14>Mo..Monster!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_15>Hohoho! Don't worry! If we have [Bonheur] and [Anima]!</ScenarioTalk90_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_16>If we have the dragon change by [Awakening] that monster is no match…!</ScenarioTalk90_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_17>It…it can't be! Why isn't the dragon changing?!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_18>My..my research!! It's impossible that my research failed!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_19>This isn't happening! This! Cannot be!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_20>Mamo Ruddik is losing his mind! Monsters are approaching!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_21>We..we cannot win! What's with this power..!</ScenarioTalk90_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_22>This isn't true!! I can't return like this!</ScenarioTalk90_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_23>That's right! I'm not wrong! You're dragons are weak!</ScenarioTalk90_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_24>What! That old man is out of his mind!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_25>Who do you think helped you out until now! What are you talking about!</ScenarioTalk90_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_26>So much for the Hero of Yutakan!! You bunch of..!</ScenarioTalk90_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_27>Watch out! Ugggh!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_28>Annie came and saved Mamo Ruddik and collapsed</ScenarioTalk90_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_29>Ms. Annie?!</ScenarioTalk90_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_30>Now's our chance! Let's run!!</ScenarioTalk90_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_31>I can't agree more! Hurry and run!! </ScenarioTalk90_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_32>After a while Mamo Ruddik recovered his rationality</ScenarioTalk90_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_33>…I'm sorry, I can't believe I acted that rashly.</ScenarioTalk90_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_34>You've almost got us killed! Are you out of your mind?!</ScenarioTalk90_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_35>Well~because of someone who acted immature..Ms.Annie is lying on the floor over there.</ScenarioTalk90_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_36>…I've yet again received help from her.</ScenarioTalk90_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_37>I've researched to great extent to help her out…it was all for naught…</ScenarioTalk90_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_38>What do you mean…you've received help from her again??</ScenarioTalk90_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_39>…Something happened in the past right?</ScenarioTalk90_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_40>……</ScenarioTalk90_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_41>Maybe it was my error in the past.</ScenarioTalk90_1_41>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_42>I wanted knowledge more than anybody.</ScenarioTalk90_1_42>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_43>But that greed was too much…so I continued on with research that was forbidden.</ScenarioTalk90_1_43>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_44>So naturally I've received sanctions from the magic-engineering society and was on the verge of being banished.</ScenarioTalk90_1_44>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_45>…….</ScenarioTalk90_1_45>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_46>…….</ScenarioTalk90_1_46>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_47>The only person who defended me was Annie.</ScenarioTalk90_1_47>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_48>She took all the blame and Annie had to resign from the society.</ScenarioTalk90_1_48>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_49>…She believed her foolish master's act until the end. A person like me.</ScenarioTalk90_1_49>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_50>So I've decided to take my revenge on the society.</ScenarioTalk90_1_50>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_51>If my research succeeds Annie's honor might be restored</ScenarioTalk90_1_51>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_52>….but it's all over now. After all that, my research was for naught.</ScenarioTalk90_1_52>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_53>…….</ScenarioTalk90_1_53>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_54>…….</ScenarioTalk90_1_54>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_55>…A very moving story.</ScenarioTalk90_1_55>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_56>Ms. Annie?!</ScenarioTalk90_1_56>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_57>I...I'm not that badly injured, I was just knocked unconscious for a second</ScenarioTalk90_1_57>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_58>That old man's problem was that he is always careless</ScenarioTalk90_1_58>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_59>There is a missing ingredient in the formula note that he left behind by chance</ScenarioTalk90_1_59>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_60>Here..here's the research method with filling in the missing formula</ScenarioTalk90_1_60>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_61>..This should make it successful</ScenarioTalk90_1_61>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_62>What a moving master and pupil relationship…</ScenarioTalk90_1_62>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_63>Sh…shut up…!</ScenarioTalk90_1_63>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_64>…I can't do anything without you can I?</ScenarioTalk90_1_64>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_65>Then I leave you my research…no OUR old research to complete</ScenarioTalk90_1_65>
    <ScenarioTalk90_1_66>There was a faint light in the side of, now a brighter, Mamo Ruddik's eyes</ScenarioTalk90_1_66>
    
    <!--마모루딕4막-->
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_1>Alright! It's complete now!!</ScenarioTalk91_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_2>This is..Anima and Bonheur…Huh what's this?</ScenarioTalk91_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_3>A weird stone with an image of a dragon?</ScenarioTalk91_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_4>That is a magic stone to power up dragons</ScenarioTalk91_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_5>If it wasn't for the help of the person exhausted in the lab</ScenarioTalk91_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_6>It probably won't be made.</ScenarioTalk91_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_7>So much for the genius magic-engineer..You've received the aid of your pupil 'til the end didn't you?</ScenarioTalk91_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_8>Well~She's an excellent pupil.</ScenarioTalk91_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_9>With this item you will be able to proceed with your dragon's [Awakening]</ScenarioTalk91_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_10>Of course we're in our testing stages so we don't know how to awaken it.</ScenarioTalk91_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_11>…Don't tell me you don't know how to awaken the dragon.</ScenarioTalk91_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_12>That means…we need to find out by ourselves?</ScenarioTalk91_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_13>Bu..but the formula isn't wrong! This time it's for sure!</ScenarioTalk91_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk91_1_14>I beg of you! Defeat the Ancient gatekeeper and prove the result of this research to the world!!</ScenarioTalk91_1_14>
    
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_1>Wha..what's this! So much for the dragon awakening! We'll be killed at this rate!</ScenarioTalk91_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_2>There must be a way…At this rate we'll be done for!</ScenarioTalk91_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_3>It can't be! It’s the equipment according to the formula for sure..!</ScenarioTalk91_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_4>Is..is it really that my research is a sham?!</ScenarioTalk91_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_5>Are you guys a complete idiot! You took the wrong magic stone!!</ScenarioTalk91_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_6>The dragon started to react with the magic stone of awakening that Annie threw</ScenarioTalk91_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_7>This…this is?!</ScenarioTalk91_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_8>Oh oh oh?!</ScenarioTalk91_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_9>Woah!!</ScenarioTalk91_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_10>What..what happened?</ScenarioTalk91_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_11>It's an incredible power…</ScenarioTalk91_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_12>It’s a success! The research is a success!!</ScenarioTalk91_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_13>…What a silly old man</ScenarioTalk91_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_14>It was an awesome power right? That dragon awakening back there?!</ScenarioTalk91_2_14>
    
    
    
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_15>Everything around there went boom and that powerful Ancient gatekeeper fell…</ScenarioTalk91_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_16>No matter what the dragon awakening research succeeded.</ScenarioTalk91_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_17>That's right! He had a very confident look and went to present the result to the magic-engineering society</ScenarioTalk91_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_18>Maybe this time he'll recover his honor and make his name known to the world!</ScenarioTalk91_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_19>With this we won't have to worry about that Origin of Darkness or something right?</ScenarioTalk91_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_20>We'll be able to defeat it with the dragon's power of [Awakening]</ScenarioTalk91_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_21>But…in the end it's only him who knows the formula for the awakening?!</ScenarioTalk91_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_22>Th..that's right?! It was us who went through all that hardship!!</ScenarioTalk91_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_23>…That old man isn't that narrow-minded.</ScenarioTalk91_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_24>He may not be that honest…but he has a kind heart.</ScenarioTalk91_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_25>He drew a rough map of where he's going to stay kindly enough, I think he's planning to stay here for a quite a while.</ScenarioTalk91_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_26>That means! He will make the dragons awaken if we go there?!</ScenarioTalk91_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_27>Probably. After all you were the ones who gave him the greatest help.</ScenarioTalk91_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_28>Ms. Annie will you visit there often as well?</ScenarioTalk91_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_29>…….</ScenarioTalk91_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk91_2_30>Well~if I have the spare time? Maybe once?</ScenarioTalk91_2_30>
    
    <ScenarioTalk91_3_1>…The dragon was weak and couldn't defeat the Ancient Gatekeeper</ScenarioTalk91_3_1>
    <ScenarioTalk91_3_2>You need a dragon a little bit stronger! You shouldn't give up!!</ScenarioTalk91_3_2>
    <ScenarioTalk91_3_3>This time…we need to find out the secret of awakening!</ScenarioTalk91_3_3>
    <!-- 카데스 지역 시나리오 1막 -->
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_1>Alright. Everything is perfect.</ScenarioTalk92_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_2>I failed to control him at first, but this time I will for sure….</ScenarioTalk92_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_3>Give rebirth so that he is the strongest species lead by the Black Robe.</ScenarioTalk92_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_4>Good! Now with these as sacrifices…!</ScenarioTalk92_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_5>Awaken now! The Black Creations!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_6>Da, damn it…! What is the problem?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_7>If I can't awake him! I cannot follow the Supereme Being! Lord Kades anymore!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_8>…Looks like you have failed. Give up.</ScenarioTalk92_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_9>There is no way to gather that much mana in the first place.</ScenarioTalk92_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_10>It will be wise to find another way.</ScenarioTalk92_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_11>What an arrogant meddling…How dare you contempt me from your ranks!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_12>…….</ScenarioTalk92_1_12>
    
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_13>…But it does makes sense. We can't gather powerful mana with these petty beings</ScenarioTalk92_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_14>But if there is a stronger being…Yes! That's it!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_15>Awaken him at once! I have a great idea!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_16>Kuhehe! Kuhahahahahaha!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_17>…….</ScenarioTalk92_1_17>
    
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_18>…What's all this noise in the middle of the night?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_19>Ahhhh!!! You shouldn't be sleeping like this!</ScenarioTalk92_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_20>Hurry! Kanggalo and the village guards have been dispatched to the Forest of Hope!</ScenarioTalk92_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_21> It seems! A very scary monster is heading towards Elpis!</ScenarioTalk92_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_22>I hurried to the Forest of Hope with Nuri and Jimon</ScenarioTalk92_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_23>Mr…Mr. Kanggalo?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_24>Tsk! Where did such a scary thing come from…!</ScenarioTalk92_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_25>All the gurads are down! It doesn't seem like a easy foe….huh? That is?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_26>…A berserk Dark frosty?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_27>Everyone run! That isn't an easy foe!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_28>I summoned the dragon with my Tamer Arms and prepared for battle</ScenarioTalk92_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_29>A…amazing?! You defeated that scary foe with ease</ScenarioTalk92_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_30>That's obvious! WE are~ the best Dragon Tamer in all of Yutakan!</ScenarioTalk92_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_31>Not "WE". You are still an unskilled Dragon Tamer.</ScenarioTalk92_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_32>Hahahaha! I agree to Jimon's oppinion!!</ScenarioTalk92_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_33>…Pff!</ScenarioTalk92_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_34>Hm? What's this?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_35>Nuri found something from where the berserk Dark frosty has disappeared from</ScenarioTalk92_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_36>A black Magic Stone. It has a chilly feeling</ScenarioTalk92_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_37>…That looks ominous. That Magic Stone?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_38>It might be a clue for this rumble so let's set this aside.</ScenarioTalk92_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_39>But…it seems like that berserk Dark Frosti has been defeated before.</ScenarioTalk92_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_40>It can't be! That Black thingy!! Is up to something bad?!</ScenarioTalk92_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_41>Not Black thingy…Black Rob….</ScenarioTalk92_1_41>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_42>Who cares about the name! They are bad guys right?</ScenarioTalk92_1_42>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_43>It is true in the past the Black Robes have used berserk Dark Frosti as a battle weapon</ScenarioTalk92_1_43>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_44>Is it possible that they are plotting something scary from somewhere I don't know?</ScenarioTalk92_1_44>
    <ScenarioTalk92_1_45>I should go see someone who knows about this Magic Stone before things get out of hand!</ScenarioTalk92_1_45>

    <!-- 카데스 지역 시나리오 2막 -->
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_1>…….</ScenarioTalk93_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_2>Yuria look at the [Black Magic Stone] from all angles</ScenarioTalk93_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_3>…A bad feeling is always right like a bad joke.</ScenarioTalk93_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_4>It can't be...?</ScenarioTalk93_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_5>Is this also by those Black thingy guys?!</ScenarioTalk93_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_6>I can't be sure but these symbol of magic and the injection style it their's.</ScenarioTalk93_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_7>It seems like the [Berserk Dark Frosti] that came to Elpis is of their bidding</ScenarioTalk93_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_8>"What did they set out for to get in Elpis?"</ScenarioTalk93_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_9>.......</ScenarioTalk93_1_9>

    <ScenarioTalk93_1_10>One thing for sure is that they have tried to make strong servant over a long period of time…</ScenarioTalk93_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_11>I'm guessing that there seems to be a connection with all these events.</ScenarioTalk93_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_12>Strong servant…Its certain that the berserk Dark Frosti was also experimented for that purpose</ScenarioTalk93_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_13>First I will look into this mysterious [Black Magic Stone]</ScenarioTalk93_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_14>By the way…the guard captain Mr. Kanggalo is looking for you guys in a hurry</ScenarioTalk93_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_15>Mr. Kanggalo?</ScenarioTalk93_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_16>It..its obvious! He's trying to make us do annoying work!!</ScenarioTalk93_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_17>I requested the examination of [Black Magic Stone] to Yuria and headed to Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk93_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_18>Mm~ You arrived on time!!</ScenarioTalk93_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_19>Wh..what are you going to ask us to do?!</ScenarioTalk93_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_20>Oh~You guys see right through me! Spot on!!</ScenarioTalk93_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_21>The gurads that went to explore the [UnderWater Cave] in the [Area of Kades] has not come back yet.</ScenarioTalk93_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_22>I want you to go to the [Area of Kades] to explore the [UnderWater Cave].</ScenarioTalk93_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_23>Aren't you asking a ve~ry dangerous job like it's very easy?</ScenarioTalk93_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_24>He..heroes of justice is supposed to be like that! Responsibility and weight!!</ScenarioTalk93_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_25>…Hmph!</ScenarioTalk93_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_26>Alright~ Now that's settled so let's hurry.</ScenarioTalk93_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_27>You might find a clue that might help out Yuria's examination</ScenarioTalk93_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_28>I told Kanggalo that I understood</ScenarioTalk93_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_29>Nuri and Jimon went to investigate the UnderWater Cave. They should be back by now…</ScenarioTalk93_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_30>We found where the guards were knocked out! But its being protected by [Demon Shelter]!</ScenarioTalk93_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_31>It seems like we need to defeat it in order to safely rescue the guards!</ScenarioTalk93_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_32>But…Something troubles me, it seems like its behavior is odd</ScenarioTalk93_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_33>Its behavior…?</ScenarioTalk93_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_34>We don't have time! If we delay any longer the gurads will be done for by the [Demon Shelter]!</ScenarioTalk93_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk93_1_35>I nodded and hurried to the UnderWater Cave</ScenarioTalk93_1_35>

    <!--카데스 지역 시나리오 3막 서브퀘스트완료시-->
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_1>He..here are the guards knocked unconcious!!</ScenarioTalk93_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_2>I left the guards in Nuri and Jimon's hand and went to investigate the [Demon Shelter]</ScenarioTalk93_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_3>[Demon Shelter] is a monster that fears light…But how did it get out here?</ScenarioTalk93_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_4>And the guards were even patrolling outside the UnderWater Cave….what caused it?</ScenarioTalk93_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_5>…An action against instinct can only be done when you are out of your mind.</ScenarioTalk93_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_6>"What do you mean by that?"</ScenarioTalk93_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_7>I'm just saying~! Maybe the reason the light-hating [Demon Shelter] attacking the guards on ground</ScenarioTalk93_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_8>is because someone with great power! Is actually controlling it~that kind of secret you know!</ScenarioTalk93_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_9>Don't say strange things! Help me with the guards here! Nuri!!</ScenarioTalk93_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_10>Yes~Roger that!!</ScenarioTalk93_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_11>It was being controlled? Controlling a monster strong as this?</ScenarioTalk93_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_12>…For what reason?</ScenarioTalk93_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_13>…?</ScenarioTalk93_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_14>Is it just me… or does the color seem gone darker than before?</ScenarioTalk93_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk93_2_15>…I should take a rest.</ScenarioTalk93_2_15>

    <!-- 카데스 지역 시나리오 3막 -->
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_1>I told what happened at the UnderWater Cave to Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk94_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_2>That's odd. [Demon Shelter] came outside and attacked the guards?</ScenarioTalk94_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_3>What's more…is that it didn't eat them and seemed like taking them hostages.</ScenarioTalk94_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_4>I have been a guard for a long time, but I haven't seen Demon Shelter act like that before.</ScenarioTalk94_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_5>I told you! Its obviously~A big evil group is controlling them!! You know like Hut-hut!</ScenarioTalk94_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_6>Isn't it… that you want to show off by just taking random guesses?</ScenarioTalk94_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_7>[Hick-up!]</ScenarioTalk94_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_8>Well…Its probably not a very~ farfectched guess. Anwyay Ms.Yuria is waiting for you guys.</ScenarioTalk94_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_9>After you come back…There is another thing….to ask for you about guarding the village.</ScenarioTalk94_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_10>…….</ScenarioTalk94_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_11>…….</ScenarioTalk94_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_12>He..hero of justice is supposed to be tiresome~ Now off you go!</ScenarioTalk94_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_13>I have examined this [Black Magic Stone] like you've aked me to do….</ScenarioTalk94_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_14>Di..did you find about something?!</ScenarioTalk94_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_15>An ingredient for somesort of strong weapon?!</ScenarioTalk94_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_16>…….</ScenarioTalk94_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_17>…I didn't find anything.</ScenarioTalk94_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_18>Huuuuuhhh?!</ScenarioTalk94_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_19>Was it a complicated object that even Ms. Yuria couldn't figure out.</ScenarioTalk94_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_20>I asked about anything, even a small noticing about the Black Magic Stone</ScenarioTalk94_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_21>It might be my imagination, but for an instant the color of it went darker.</ScenarioTalk94_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_22>Of course… I don't know what caused it to become of a darker color.</ScenarioTalk94_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_23>The Black Magic Stone's color became darker…?</ScenarioTalk94_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_24>What do you mean…How can the color become darker when the Black Magic Stone isn't a living creature.</ScenarioTalk94_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_25>Well~First let's think about it later and go take care about the request that Mr.Kanggalo made.</ScenarioTalk94_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_26>[Zeus Jr.] has been appearing frequently at the [Sky Temple].</ScenarioTalk94_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_27>Will the Tamers please be set an example for the public order and defeat [] of [Zeus Jr.]</ScenarioTalk94_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_28>PS. Awesome guy Kanggalo, age 35, searching for a lifelong friend.</ScenarioTalk94_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_29>…….</ScenarioTalk94_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_30>…….</ScenarioTalk94_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk94_1_31>…….</ScenarioTalk94_1_31>
    
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_1>I didn't know that this many [Zeus Jr.] will appear near [Sky Temple]</ScenarioTalk94_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_2>Its as if…These monsters have been set loose by someone on purpose.</ScenarioTalk94_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_3>I also think that's true! Something is fishy!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_4>Maybe! This phenomenon is also related to that Black Magic Stone…</ScenarioTalk94_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_5>Well done. For a bunch of arrogant fools!</ScenarioTalk94_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_6>Black Robe?!</ScenarioTalk94_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_7>So it was your doing afterall!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_8>You jerk! Wha..what are you trying to do?!</ScenarioTalk94_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_9>Our purpose and mission has always been lead to one.</ScenarioTalk94_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_10>To serve the Great God of Darkness Kades with our lives.</ScenarioTalk94_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_11>The other is! To rid of all the petty beings that interfere with the God of Darkness!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_12>It can't be! All these monsters at once!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_13>Why you! You've been digging a trap?!</ScenarioTalk94_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_14>No way~ You're arrogance have lead you to your own doom!</ScenarioTalk94_2_14>

    <ScenarioTalk94_2_22>Indeed remarkable! But this will the last…!</ScenarioTalk94_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_23>Th..the Wing of Light! Everybody run!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_23>

    <ScenarioTalk94_2_25>Is there anywhere injured; Oh Pilgrim of Light</ScenarioTalk94_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_26>I told that I wasn't greatly injured but Nuri and Jimon received heavy damage.</ScenarioTalk94_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_27>I will lead these two travellers safely to the village.</ScenarioTalk94_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_28>As I see Yutakan from the Tower of Light, endless amounts of hideous monsters were appearing.</ScenarioTalk94_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_29>You must defeat the hoard of monsters. Hurry, Pilgrim of Light.</ScenarioTalk94_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_30>I need to hurry, Black Robe and monsters are after the village!</ScenarioTalk94_2_30>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_31>It was the chance to finish off that brat…that mystical creature of Deiz!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_31>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_32>Isn't it a bad move if Aeuros notices our movement?</ScenarioTalk94_2_32>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_33>Kukuku! On the contrary that's actually a good thing!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_33>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_34>Now those stupid fools will feel endangered and defeat the monsters with all their might!</ScenarioTalk94_2_34>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_35>and even if the Wing of Light is there, as long as we have THEM holding out they cannot attack us.</ScenarioTalk94_2_35>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_36>Then what is my duty?</ScenarioTalk94_2_36>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_37>Hide among them; and wait for orders!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_37>
    <ScenarioTalk94_2_38>Every thing is as planned! Every thing for the supreme God of Darkness Kades!!</ScenarioTalk94_2_38>

    <!-- 카데스 지역 시나리오 4막 -->
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_1>The village is noisy. What happened?</ScenarioTalk95_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_2>Wel..welcome back! Thank goodness you are alright. We heard the news from Nuri and Jimon!</ScenarioTalk95_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_3>I never knew…that this event is related to that evil Black Robe...!</ScenarioTalk95_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_4>Hold on, it seems the gurads who went on patrol to the woods came back.</ScenarioTalk95_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_5>..This is bad.</ScenarioTalk95_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_6>I asked Kanggalo what was wrong</ScenarioTalk95_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_7>Some of the gurads seems to have been captrued by the monsters.</ScenarioTalk95_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_8>They are threatening us to give up on the defense of Elpis for the safety of the hostages!</ScenarioTalk95_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_9>I asked Kanggalo where the guards were captured</ScenarioTalk95_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_10>The guard are being held hostage at the [Forest of Hope]!</ScenarioTalk95_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_11>Th..that's right! Taking this note will help!!</ScenarioTalk95_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_12>It’s a note written by parts of the guard who managed to escape. This might indicate the location!</ScenarioTalk95_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk95_1_13>I received the note from Kanggalo and hurried to the [Forest of Hope]</ScenarioTalk95_1_13>

    <ScenarioTalk95_3_3>Images made of arrows were scribbled on the paper</ScenarioTalk95_3_3>
    <ScenarioTalk95_3_4>Could this mean where the guards are being kept?</ScenarioTalk95_3_4>

    <ScenarioTalk95_F_1>Is this the right way? Why am I feel like I'm going in circles?</ScenarioTalk95_F_1>
    <ScenarioTalk95_F_2>Oh no! I've been found by monsters!!</ScenarioTalk95_F_2>
    <ScenarioTalk95_F_3>The other monsters noticed me and took the hostages and ran away!</ScenarioTalk95_F_3>
    <ScenarioTalk95_F_4>The hostage rescue failed!</ScenarioTalk95_F_4>
    <ScenarioTalk95_F_5>Let's try to rescue the hostages with the note Kanggalo gave me and my experience</ScenarioTalk95_F_5>
    <ScenarioTalk95_F_6>Kanggalo's note is marked with the paths [Right][??][Left][??][Right][??][??] 길이 표시되어있다</ScenarioTalk95_F_6>
    <ScenarioTalk95_F_7>Don't give up and try again!</ScenarioTalk95_F_7>

    <ScenarioTalk95_2_1>I found the guards knocked out in the corner</ScenarioTalk95_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_2>It has to be! These are the ones who went on a search mission in the morning!</ScenarioTalk95_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_3>Its all thanks to you! You have done great!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_4>I told it would have been more difficult if I didn't have Kanggalo's note</ScenarioTalk95_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_5>First we need to return to the village. The sudden increase of monsters....</ScenarioTalk95_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_6>They are still in a fierce battle with the guards who are guarding the perimeters!</ScenarioTalk95_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_7>I hurried back to the village with Kanggalo</ScenarioTalk95_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_8>…It must be.</ScenarioTalk95_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_9>It Black Magic Stone's color is becoming darker as the battle with the monsters becomes more intense.</ScenarioTalk95_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_10>It can't be! The monster's raid and the Black Magic Stone's discovery was from the first place!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_11>Surely~ Its Yuria…You found about that fact. But its too late!</ScenarioTalk95_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_12>So it was you all along!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_13>Still a talent being so wasted. You indeed would have been a loyal servant of darkness.</ScenarioTalk95_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_14>I am not with you anymore!</ScenarioTalk95_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_15>But…I cannot allow you to interfere with our business.</ScenarioTalk95_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_16>I won't go down so easily!</ScenarioTalk95_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_17>Is that so? If you make any foolish move I can't guarantee the lives of the villagers.</ScenarioTalk95_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_18>…You coward!</ScenarioTalk95_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_19>Ugh!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_20>It was a precise and vicious plan.</ScenarioTalk95_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_21>This is called wise, you brat. Now take the Black Magic Stone!</ScenarioTalk95_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_22>All the preparation is finished! Now comes the time to end the cursed light!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_23>…What is it at this late hour?!</ScenarioTalk95_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_24>The fortune-teller's house was raided by unidentified people. Yuria is unconcious by the wounds.</ScenarioTalk95_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_25>!?</ScenarioTalk95_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_26>Th..that's impossible! There is no one that can't get through Elpis' defense!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_27>A regular monster or a villian can't but...</ScenarioTalk95_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_28>It can't be!</ScenarioTalk95_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_29>It is obvious that the Black Robes attacked Yuria!</ScenarioTalk95_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_30>I found out that the [Black Magic Stone] has dissappeared while I was investigating the fortune-teller's house</ScenarioTalk95_2_30>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_31>Wha..what! What is that sound?!</ScenarioTalk95_2_31>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_32>That light is….Dear God! How can the [Chaos Fear] have awakened!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_32>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_33>Even the Pilgrim of Light cannot stop him alone!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_33>
    <ScenarioTalk95_2_34>…There is no time! To overcome this crisis we need help!!</ScenarioTalk95_2_34>

    <!-- 카데스 지역 시나리오 5막 -->
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_1>I explained everything that happened in detail to Aeuros</ScenarioTalk96_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_2>As expected the [Chaos Fear] has appeared. [Chaos Fear] is....</ScenarioTalk96_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_3>Is a loyal servent of the God of Darkness Kades who have lead many lives to death in the past.</ScenarioTalk96_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_4>Maybe this task requires the help of those who follow the Pilgrim of Light.</ScenarioTalk96_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_5>Thos who follow me...?</ScenarioTalk96_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_6>Let's go meet our old friend together. We will need their help.</ScenarioTalk96_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_7>Like the records of the pasat we need to stop our confrontation and gather our strength to one.</ScenarioTalk96_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_8>I nodded my head at Aeuros' word</ScenarioTalk96_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_9>…Interesting. You declined our request for help and now seek out for one.</ScenarioTalk96_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_10>The Pilgrim of Light seems to not think about normal human righteousness, don't you?</ScenarioTalk96_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_11>Angelo! Rudeness will not be tolerated!!</ScenarioTalk96_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_12>This person is the righteous person who saved Elysium. Please watch your manner!</ScenarioTalk96_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_13>.......</ScenarioTalk96_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_14>…We have listened to your story oh Pilgrim of Light.</ScenarioTalk96_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_15>You have stopped the Ancient Demon Kronak that have lead Elysium to doom.</ScenarioTalk96_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_16>That action was above all a noble sacrifice and blessing for us.</ScenarioTalk96_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_17>However…Unfortunately we are at war with the Dwarves at the moment.</ScenarioTalk96_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_18>We cannot support a large group of troops to Yutakan now.</ScenarioTalk96_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_19>But my queen. If we can't help them now a bigger crisis can fall upon us.</ScenarioTalk96_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_20>How rude! How dare a lowly warrior like you speak infront of the queen!</ScenarioTalk96_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_21>We have received a grace that is bigger than anything else from them</ScenarioTalk96_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_22>If we disregard that grace and decline to help we are no better than villains....</ScenarioTalk96_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_23>I can't stand it anymore! Drag this arrogant fool out at once!!</ScenarioTalk96_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_24>Both of you stop!</ScenarioTalk96_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_25>.......</ScenarioTalk96_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_26>.......</ScenarioTalk96_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_27>Florence is right. We have indeed received your grace.</ScenarioTalk96_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_28>…However our situation does not change. We cannot be much of a help.</ScenarioTalk96_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_29>.......</ScenarioTalk96_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_30>You arrogant foold…! How dare you!!</ScenarioTalk96_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_31>Farewell then....</ScenarioTalk96_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_32>We explain the situation but couldn't get help from the Elves.</ScenarioTalk96_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_33>What should we do…Should we go see the dwarves?</ScenarioTalk96_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_34>It has been a long time. I'm glad I'm not late.</ScenarioTalk96_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_35>…Berutaon?</ScenarioTalk96_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_36>The Queen wants this dilivered to you seperately.</ScenarioTalk96_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_37>[Go to the Spirit Forest]?</ScenarioTalk96_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_38>The Queen must retain her authority and neutrality infront of people.</ScenarioTalk96_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_39>Even infront of the savior that we have received such grace.</ScenarioTalk96_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_40>…But it doesn't matter if nobody is looking right? </ScenarioTalk96_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk96_1_41>Now- Go before its too late!</ScenarioTalk96_1_41>
    
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_1>We arrived at the Spirit Forest. Nothing in particular is in sight</ScenarioTalk96_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_2>How are you here…?</ScenarioTalk96_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_3>I told that I was here because Berutaon asked me to be here</ScenarioTalk96_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_4>I..I also came here on behalf of Berutaon….</ScenarioTalk96_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_5>We have safely met each other. Thank goodness!</ScenarioTalk96_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_6>Forgive me for the rudeness at the castle oh Pilgrim of Light.</ScenarioTalk96_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_7>Aidra?</ScenarioTalk96_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_8>And I'm sorry to Florence as well.</ScenarioTalk96_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_9>N..No I'm the one who is…!</ScenarioTalk96_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_10>Berutaon. We cannot move large amount of troops since we are at war.</ScenarioTalk96_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_11>That is correct!</ScenarioTalk96_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_12>But it is okay to move as an individual not a troop correct?</ScenarioTalk96_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_13>That is correct!!</ScenarioTalk96_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_14>!!</ScenarioTalk96_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_15>Florence, please aid the Pilgrim of Light to save Yutakan.</ScenarioTalk96_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_16>If you, strongest among all of the female warriors of Elysium, help them there will be no problem.</ScenarioTalk96_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_17>As you wish, your highness!</ScenarioTalk96_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_18>Oh Pilgrim of Light, may the White Hawk be with you on your journey</ScenarioTalk96_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk96_2_19>I thanked the kindness o f Aidra and hurried to the Metal Tower.</ScenarioTalk96_2_19>

    <!--카데스 지역 시나리오 6막-->
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_1>.......</ScenarioTalk97_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_2>You are indeed the savior who saved us from our crisis.</ScenarioTalk97_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_3>If you didn't stop Kaciz, this country would have surely collapsed.</ScenarioTalk97_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_4>…However, a large number of troop cannot move for Yutakan.</ScenarioTalk97_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_5>The fangs of monsters are always preying upon us from outside our borders.</ScenarioTalk97_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_6>You surely know why we risk our lives to seek Magic Stones?!</ScenarioTalk97_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_7>But isn't declining the request of our savior…is worse than an act of a vermin?!</ScenarioTalk97_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_8>How dare you speak with your open hole! You hypocrite of the forest!!</ScenarioTalk97_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_9>Hmph! Coming from coldblooded being who extends their lives by always destroying something!!</ScenarioTalk97_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_10>How dare you! You dare insult my people in our lands!!</ScenarioTalk97_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_11>Aren't you delusional? I've only retorted back on how you treated me!</ScenarioTalk97_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_12>You fools!</ScenarioTalk97_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_13>What is this indecency! Keep your manners in front of your savior!!</ScenarioTalk97_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_14>Ugh...!</ScenarioTalk97_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_15>.......</ScenarioTalk97_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_16>…Please let me have a moment to think, Pilgrim of Light.</ScenarioTalk97_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_17>I told Srorin that I understood.</ScenarioTalk97_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_18>…Please forgive my rudeness.</ScenarioTalk97_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_19>I said I didn't mind</ScenarioTalk97_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_20>You are our savior who above all aided us.</ScenarioTalk97_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_21>However…Even at the time when we need to repay our debt we are incompetent.</ScenarioTalk97_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_22>After Kaciz has fallen the monster raid have increased in number.</ScenarioTalk97_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_23>It is as if….a large malice is trying to bite our neck off.</ScenarioTalk97_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_24>.......</ScenarioTalk97_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_25>…Hold on?</ScenarioTalk97_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_26>There is a certain nuisance who doesn't play by the rules in this country!</ScenarioTalk97_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_27>Go to the [Fire Dragon Nest]! That person will be there.</ScenarioTalk97_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_28>This is all I could help you with…Please becareful.</ScenarioTalk97_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_29>I replied to Srorin's farewell</ScenarioTalk97_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_30>A nuisance who doesn't play by the rules?</ScenarioTalk97_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_31>Hm~ That person will give us their hand….</ScenarioTalk97_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_32>Aha~ I think I know what kind of person that is!!</ScenarioTalk97_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk97_1_33>I involuntarily smiled at the reaction Florence made</ScenarioTalk97_1_33>

    <ScenarioTalk97_2_1>Maybe Srorin's words were wrong? There is no sign of anybody in sight</ScenarioTalk97_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_2>Th..there! There is someone over there!!</ScenarioTalk97_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_3>Have you not found the mineral yet? Mirba?!</ScenarioTalk97_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_4>No..not yet~ But before that…shouldn't we take a break?!</ScenarioTalk97_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_5>….You have not forgetten the purpose of finding minerals have you?</ScenarioTalk97_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_6>Of course not! But if we eat something wouldn't it be easier to...</ScenarioTalk97_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_7>Ah! It must be. That short figure and a face with dissatisfaction!!</ScenarioTalk97_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_8>…Just my luck today, how did I meet that lanky monster today!</ScenarioTalk97_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_9>Oh~ Its like I-wanted-to-find-you, you know?</ScenarioTalk97_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_10>Oh ho? Is that so? Then you should just move along with your stroll then!!</ScenarioTalk97_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_11>You still have quite the horrible temper don't you?</ScenarioTalk97_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_12>Look who's talking?</ScenarioTalk97_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_13>.......</ScenarioTalk97_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_14>I went up to Arnold and said hello</ScenarioTalk97_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_15>Oh! Look who it is~ you should have told me you were coming!!</ScenarioTalk97_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_16>Can't you think that somebody was not home and we couldn't send the word beforehand?</ScenarioTalk97_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_17>You! Why are you picking on every word I say all the time!</ScenarioTalk97_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_18>I asked Arnold what he was doing at the Fire Dragon Nest</ScenarioTalk97_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_19>Aah…I came here because Mirba here wanted to find minerals</ScenarioTalk97_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_20>I…I will be going now then!</ScenarioTalk97_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_21>What is it…She asked me to come along first!</ScenarioTalk97_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_22>It must not be that dangerous around where we are now right?</ScenarioTalk97_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_23>Well~ yeah, Mirba could have just come here by herself but she insisted on dragging me along</ScenarioTalk97_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_24>Oh ho~ So that was the reason….Not bad from your looks you know?</ScenarioTalk97_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_25>What are you talking about! You skinny piece of monster!</ScenarioTalk97_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_26>What!! How dare you, you little hairy scumbag!</ScenarioTalk97_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_27>I stopped their fighting and explained the situation</ScenarioTalk97_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_28>Of course I will help! Let's go to Yutakan right away!!</ScenarioTalk97_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_29>…Ar..aren't you going to consider even a little bit? You know like the situation of your country..?!</ScenarioTalk97_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_30>Of course not! After all its for my friend!!</ScenarioTalk97_2_30>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_31>Even the King will be glad for an action for a friend regardless of permission!</ScenarioTalk97_2_31>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_32>These people still lack the delicacy. These short fellows…</ScenarioTalk97_2_32>
    <ScenarioTalk97_2_33>….That sound like an insult you know?!</ScenarioTalk97_2_33>

    <!--카데스 지역 시나리오 7막-->
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_1>Yuria greeted us with a rather weary face. It looked like her wounds were not fully healed</ScenarioTalk98_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_2>…What a beautiful face looking so weary. What a catastrophy!!</ScenarioTalk98_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_3>Don't mind the weird old fellow over there. It has been a while. How is your health?</ScenarioTalk98_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_4>I am not that badly hurt as you worry. But the problem is what comes after.</ScenarioTalk98_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_5>I asked why the Black Robe attacked and what their purpose was</ScenarioTalk98_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_6>…Everything was a trap set by the Black Robe. The monsters' frequent appearance was part of that plan.</ScenarioTalk98_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_7>The Black Robe converted the anger that the monster had into mana and collected it in the Black Magic Stone.</ScenarioTalk98_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_8>I strong opponent was needed to encourage the fighting spirit of a monster.</ScenarioTalk98_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_9>That is why you were chosen. You fought for the purpose of protecting the village....</ScenarioTalk98_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_10>But infact was being played with by the evil Black Robe's plan</ScenarioTalk98_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_11>So what! They gave us the Black Magic Stone to us so that we can examine it…</ScenarioTalk98_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_12>and after a sufficient amount of mana was gathered after defeating monsters, they showed their true color and stole it back?!</ScenarioTalk98_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_13>…We were being played with by the Black Robe's evil scheme from the start</ScenarioTalk98_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_14>Now the Black Robe will revive [Chaos Fear] with the Black Magic Stone.</ScenarioTalk98_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_15>I only know of the might of the [Chaos Fear] from my knowledge….I don't know a way to stop it.</ScenarioTalk98_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_16>How can there be such a stron monster…!</ScenarioTalk98_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_17>You don't know until you try! There is no need to be discouraged!!</ScenarioTalk98_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_18>…Maybe a being that lived on since the ancient times know a way.</ScenarioTalk98_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_19>A being that have lived for a long time. Aeuros might know a way</ScenarioTalk98_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_20>I knew you would come here. Pilgrim of Light.</ScenarioTalk98_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_21>I will show you this while the Child of Forest and the Child of Steel is gathered here as well.</ScenarioTalk98_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_22>This is an ancient record. It is a wall painting of the three races that stopped [Chaos Fear]</ScenarioTalk98_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_23>What's that? There is a myterious alter in the middle!</ScenarioTalk98_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_24>If we do something at that alter, can we defeat that Chaos whatever?!</ScenarioTalk98_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_25>Wise you are, Child of Forest and Child of Steel.</ScenarioTalk98_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_26>That alter is relic left behind by priest of light at the [Sky Temple].</ScenarioTalk98_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_27>To restore power to the alter requires all of your power together.</ScenarioTalk98_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_28>Go find the [Magic Stone] at [Blizzard Mountain] and [Stone Slate] at the [Tomb of Forest God]</ScenarioTalk98_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk98_1_29>That will be a signal to defeat the long darkness.</ScenarioTalk98_1_29>

    <ScenarioTalk98_2_1>That Magic Stone pulses with great amount of mana!</ScenarioTalk98_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk98_2_2>With this~ you can make a very neat object!!</ScenarioTalk98_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk98_2_3>I asked Arnold to take the Magic Stone back to Elpis and prepare</ScenarioTalk98_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk98_2_4>Alright! I'll tell the rest of the people about this and go to the Sky Temple!!</ScenarioTalk98_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk98_2_5>Now~ Let's hurry and go find the [Stone Slate] hidden at the [Tomb of Forest God]!</ScenarioTalk98_2_5>

    <ScenarioTalk99_1_4>Arnold is repairing the alter with the Magic Stone!</ScenarioTalk99_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk99_1_5>Yuria told that the alter can be restored perfectly only if you have the Stone Slate!</ScenarioTalk99_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk99_1_6>The guards are doing their best to protect the alter but hurry! Later then!!</ScenarioTalk99_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk99_1_7>Let's hurry!</ScenarioTalk99_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk99_1_8>We can't make everyone's effort be in vain! We need to find the [Stone Slate] at the [Tomb of Forest God]!</ScenarioTalk99_1_8>

    <ScenarioTalk99_2_3>I will make the Power of Light linger at this alter.</ScenarioTalk99_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_4>This light will engage with the power of [Chaos Fear] and weaken it..</ScenarioTalk99_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_5>Now let the light shine, let the light burn in the dark</ScenarioTalk99_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_6>[Oh the leader of the Five Gods following the Great Light]</ScenarioTalk99_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_7>[Thy servant will emit thy power, let thy burn in light]</ScenarioTalk99_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_8>[In the name of God of Fate Deiz]</ScenarioTalk99_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_9>What an enormous light! The darkness is disappearing around it!!</ScenarioTalk99_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_10>The monsters heading towards the alter and village have slowed down!</ScenarioTalk99_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_11>Go now. The Pilgrim of Light. All depends on you now.</ScenarioTalk99_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_12>…What is that light! The monster's movements….[Chaos Fear] is loosing its power!!</ScenarioTalk99_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_13>The mystical creature of Deiz…it must be the Wing of Light Aeuros.</ScenarioTalk99_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_14>Sto…stop that hideious light at once!!</ScenarioTalk99_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_15>Aeuros is the mystical creature of the God of Fate, Deiz. No mere creation can defeat it.</ScenarioTalk99_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_16>You useless scum! Then I will go there myself!!</ScenarioTalk99_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_17>[Chaos Fear]! Go to the Sky Temple!! We need to destroy that alter!!</ScenarioTalk99_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk99_2_18>All monster hoards head to Elpis! Kill them all! Destroy them all!!</ScenarioTalk99_2_18>

    <ScenarioTalk100_2_1>Its power is overwhelming. It cannot be defeated!</ScenarioTalk100_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_2>Hahahaha you pitiful insects!! No matter how much you struggle!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_2>

    <ScenarioTalk100_2_10>We must have passed out.</ScenarioTalk100_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_11>Wh..wher is Chaos Fear?! What about that blasted Black something?!</ScenarioTalk100_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_12>They're gone. We did it.</ScenarioTalk100_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_13>…Thank goodness. That foul thing is gone now.</ScenarioTalk100_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_14>Oi! You were here then!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_15>All the monsters hoards that were attacking the village are gone.</ScenarioTalk100_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_16>This is all because you guys! Now~ everybody follow me, the village is already in a mood for a festival!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_17>Well~ Its not bad to have human food once in a while isn't it?</ScenarioTalk100_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_18>I welcome all sorts of meat! It goes down easily!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_19>It would be bad for our guest of honor for today not showing up.</ScenarioTalk100_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_20>Let's go! I'm starving now!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_21>I headed to the village pulled by the words of Florence and Arnold</ScenarioTalk100_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_22>The sky was calm like a lie and a fain twinkle shimmers in the sky</ScenarioTalk100_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_23>That light is leading us like a warm hand</ScenarioTalk100_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_24>Wh..who are you…Ugh!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_25>You seemed to have been injured quite a bit. You were boasting that much and yet have lost?</ScenarioTalk100_2_25>

    <ScenarioTalk100_2_27>Spectating, watching you as you fall slowly into despair....</ScenarioTalk100_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_28>Wh…what! Why you…! Gugh!!</ScenarioTalk100_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk100_2_29>You seem to be destined to die soon. I won't have to stain my hands</ScenarioTalk100_2_29>

    <ScenarioTalk101_1_1>Everybody is enjoying the peace that has returned with a joyful expression</ScenarioTalk101_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_2>The memory of long darkness becomes faint with all the joyful faces</ScenarioTalk101_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_3>You came back safely. I knew you could do it.</ScenarioTalk101_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_4>Of course! Who am I!! I'm the best dwarvish warrior..ugh!</ScenarioTalk101_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_5>Ms. Yuria wasn't talking about you, you know...?</ScenarioTalk101_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_6>Why is the skinny monster quarreling with me on this happy day!!</ScenarioTalk101_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_7>Oh~ You're saying something that will cause great misunderstanding! I'm just saying so that Ms. Yuria doesn't get any germ….Kya!!</ScenarioTalk101_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_8>I will have my settlement today! Stop right there! You treacherous elf!!</ScenarioTalk101_1_8>

    <ScenarioTalk101_1_11>I told that it was possible because everybody gathered their strength</ScenarioTalk101_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_12>Still modest. Oh well you were like that to begin with....</ScenarioTalk101_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_13>But.. The Black Robes won't give up like this.</ScenarioTalk101_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_14>Please prepare for the invasion of the unsealed Chaos Fear.</ScenarioTalk101_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_15>It cannot approach Elpis because of the power of the [Tower of Light] at the moment....</ScenarioTalk101_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_16>If it recovers it will be set loose from the [Tower of Light] and aim for Elpis once again.</ScenarioTalk101_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_17>That's right! Its trapped in the Area of Kades…but it will seek after the village always!</ScenarioTalk101_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_18>If it escapes from the [Tower of Light] and recoves its strength and seems like to invade Elpis again!</ScenarioTalk101_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_19>I will tell you that at the speed of light! Actually~ There is no one that can stop that monster except for you!!</ScenarioTalk101_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_20>Now~ Our guest of honor seems to be tired now so we should let him go.</ScenarioTalk101_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_21>Thanks to Yuria I could finally escape from the festival</ScenarioTalk101_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_22>I hear familiar footsteps from far away</ScenarioTalk101_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_23>How should I greet them? Unknowingly a smile radiates from my face</ScenarioTalk101_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_24>It might the most awkward smile that might be the most natural</ScenarioTalk101_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_25>Wait up~! The best Dragon Tamer of Yutakan!!</ScenarioTalk101_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_26>If you leave us behind there will be a bad effect your journey!</ScenarioTalk101_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk101_1_27>I wipe my smile and take a deep breath. But unlike my mind I am already smiling</ScenarioTalk101_1_27>

    <!-- 베르나 시나리오-->
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_1>-It was a warm, sunny afternoon. I went outside to take a break.&#10;Seeing new faces jumbled on the street, I felt an excitement that I had never felt before.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_2>-I sense happiness in the air that I could never imagine only a few years ago.&#10;The fact that the two earbashers Nuri and Zimon are not here is already the blessing of Amorru to me.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_3>Bump!</ScenarioTalk102_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_4>-I felt someone bump my shoulder.&#10;When I turned around, I found something fallen on the ground.&#10;It was a parchment scroll that looked very old and worn out.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_5>-I picked it up and took a look around.&#10;I spotted a strange man in the crowd.</ScenarioTalk102_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_6>-With a hood over his face, I couldn't recognize him. But I was sure he was the one dropped the scroll.&#10;I went over to him and put my hand over his shoulder.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_7>Ugh!</ScenarioTalk102_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_8>-I reeled at the sight of his eyes.&#10;It wasn't just his gaze that terrified me. They looked otherworldly, somehow.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_9>Oh… I mean… Is this yours?</ScenarioTalk102_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_10>-All he did was looking in my direction, but I was frozen in place.Dangerous! I should get away as fast as I can…-</ScenarioTalk102_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_11>Slap!</ScenarioTalk102_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_12>I got you!&#10;Where were you? I've been looking all over for you!</ScenarioTalk102_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_13>What?&#10;You scared me! Where did you come from?</ScenarioTalk102_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_14>Ta-da, are you ready?&#10;I've got news for you. You won't believe it!</ScenarioTalk102_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_15>What's going on?</ScenarioTalk102_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_16>It was… Umm&#10;What was I going to tell you?</ScenarioTalk102_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_17>Were you gonna tell me…&#10;About the rumor that the Elves and Dwarves may start a war? I guess it's not bogus.</ScenarioTalk102_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_18>Yes! That's it!&#10;You got it right, Zimon!</ScenarioTalk102_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_19>Oh…&#10;You're the only one in all of Elpis who hasn't heard that rumor.</ScenarioTalk102_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_20>-Frankly, this is the first I've heard about this.&#10;It's best to keep my mouth shut.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_21>Well, what can I do?&#10;By the way, what's that scroll in your hand?</ScenarioTalk102_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_22>This? Some scary-looking guy dropped it…&#10;Wait, where did he go?</ScenarioTalk102_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_23>-He was right there, looking at me, but now he's gone.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_24>Hmm. This looks suspicious.&#10;Let me take a look at it!</ScenarioTalk102_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_25>-Nuri snatched it right away.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_26>Let's see… What?&#10;Oh, wow! This is unbelievable. It's a treasure map!</ScenarioTalk102_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_27>What? A treasure map?</ScenarioTalk102_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_28>See the location marked here.&#10;I've seen stuff like this in books about pirates!</ScenarioTalk102_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_29>Ha ha… There's no way that's real.&#10;Why would anyone bury their treasure underground?&#10;Huh, what's that in the map?</ScenarioTalk102_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_30>-Zimon fell into silence and stared at the map.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_31>Why? Can you see something?&#10;Is there some kind of cryptic message?</ScenarioTalk102_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_32>Hey! This is Berna Island!</ScenarioTalk102_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_33>Berna Island?&#10;I've never heard of it.</ScenarioTalk102_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_34>Don't you know about the "Mysterious Island Berna?"&#10;We all learned about it from the Tamer School…</ScenarioTalk102_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_35>Did we?&#10;Why don't I remember?</ScenarioTalk102_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_36>-Frankly, I haven't heard much, either.&#10;It's best to keep my mouth shut about it.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_37>Don't you know the story about the Dragon Berna that died after sealing Decon Rajhid?&#10;It sacrificed itself to save so many lives.&#10;Even beginning tamers know this!</ScenarioTalk102_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_38>Now, I remember!&#10;Because of the power Berna used, there are no more monsters left.&#10;I guess it'd be a great place to hang out.</ScenarioTalk102_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_39>Ha…&#10;That's a dumb idea…</ScenarioTalk102_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_40>There are no monsters in Elpis too.&#10;Is there some kind of sanctuary in Berna?</ScenarioTalk102_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_41>They say there are no monsters there because the wild animals are too powerful.&#10;It's just a myth, nothing more.</ScenarioTalk102_1_41>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_42>Why don't we go and see for ourselves?&#10;Let's see if there's any monsters and find the treasure!&#10;Great idea, right? Come on, aren't I a genius?</ScenarioTalk102_1_42>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_43>-What? How did you come to that conclusion?-</ScenarioTalk102_1_43>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_44>Hmm… Shall we borrow his wings?</ScenarioTalk102_1_44>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_45>His wings? You mean…</ScenarioTalk102_1_45>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_46>Pilgrims of the Light,&#10;I, Aeuros, respond to your voice!</ScenarioTalk102_1_46>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_47>-Before I even finished my sentence, Aeuros appeared with his gigantic wings flapping.-</ScenarioTalk102_1_47>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_48>My voice?&#10;I've never summoned you…</ScenarioTalk102_1_48>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_49>Speak of the devil!&#10;Now, let's go to that treasure island!</ScenarioTalk102_1_49>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_50>Wait…&#10;I'm not ready…</ScenarioTalk102_1_50>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_51>Don't worry!&#10;I've got everything you need!</ScenarioTalk102_1_51>
    <ScenarioTalk102_1_52>Ha…&#10;Let's go, then…</ScenarioTalk102_1_52>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_1>Ta-da, here we are!&#10;Thanks, Aeuros! Goodbye!</ScenarioTalk102_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_2>May the blessing of Amorru be upon you…</ScenarioTalk102_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_3>Ah… I can smell treasure in the air.</ScenarioTalk102_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_4>…Don't get ahead of yourself!&#10;There's a hint of warmth in the air.&#10;It kind of feels like home.</ScenarioTalk102_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_5>That's the spirit of treasure!&#10;No time to lose! Let's find that treasure!</ScenarioTalk102_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_6>-Where in the world does Nuri's never-ending energy come from…-</ScenarioTalk102_2_6>

    <ScenarioTalk102_2_8>-2 hours later-</ScenarioTalk102_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_9>Keep looking!&#10;Is this the right way?</ScenarioTalk102_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_10>I'm positive!&#10;How many times do I have to tell you?</ScenarioTalk102_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_11>If the map is correct, the treasure should be right here!&#10;But all I can see are these weird-looking rocks!</ScenarioTalk102_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_12>What have I been telling you?&#10;We shouldn't have come all the way down here, just because of a piece of paper we picked up on the street.</ScenarioTalk102_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_13>What? Picked up on the street?&#10;You just found the map on the street?</ScenarioTalk102_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_14>Yeah, I found it in the plaza…</ScenarioTalk102_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_15>Are you kidding me? He found it on the street!&#10;Why didn't you tell me that!?</ScenarioTalk102_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_16>I was about to tell you…</ScenarioTalk102_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_17>Aaaah!</ScenarioTalk102_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_18>What's that sound?&#10;It sounds like some girl screaming.</ScenarioTalk102_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_19>It's not too far, is it?</ScenarioTalk102_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_20>Someone might be in danger!&#10;It's our duty as tamers to go help!</ScenarioTalk102_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_21>What…&#10;This day just gets crazier…</ScenarioTalk102_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk102_2_22>-Zimon and I had no choice but to follow her.-</ScenarioTalk102_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_1>Aaah! Go away!&#10;I said go away…</ScenarioTalk103_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_2>Krrrghh…</ScenarioTalk103_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_3>No!&#10;Stop following me!</ScenarioTalk103_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_4>-When we got there, some girl was being chased by a monster.&#10;She was out of her breath and couldn't escape.</ScenarioTalk103_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_5>Stop it, you ugly monster!&#10;Or I'll…</ScenarioTalk103_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_6>-Right away, Nuri got between the girl and monster.&#10;What should I do? In a situation like this, I better just watch.-</ScenarioTalk103_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_7>Krrrghhh…&#10;Kaahhh!</ScenarioTalk103_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_8>Don't come too close!&#10;Stop! Don't take another step! Aaah!</ScenarioTalk103_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_9>…</ScenarioTalk103_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_10>-Agitated by Nuri's sudden appearance, the monster starts attacking her.&#10;Now, she's running all over the place to get away from it.&#10;What should I do? I've got a bad feeling about this.-</ScenarioTalk103_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_11>Hey! Guys!&#10;Don't just hide there. Do something!</ScenarioTalk103_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_12>Kaahhh!</ScenarioTalk103_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_13>Aaah!</ScenarioTalk103_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_14>-Now, Nuri's running toward us.&#10;Things are getting out of control.&#10;I can't think straight.-</ScenarioTalk103_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_15>Oh, no! What should I do!&#10;I can find the [Running away] button!&#10;Hey, we're counting on you!</ScenarioTalk103_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk103_1_16>Argh… Next time, I won't let you go!</ScenarioTalk103_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_1>Kaahhh!</ScenarioTalk103_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_2>-Each time the monster falls, it keeps getting up as if nothing happened.-</ScenarioTalk103_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_3>Oh!&#10;I've never seen a monster like this!</ScenarioTalk103_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_4>You said there are no monsters in Berna!&#10;Zimon, you told us!</ScenarioTalk103_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_5>Not monsters but demons may be!!&#10;Monsters are related to Kades!</ScenarioTalk103_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_6>Kaahhh!</ScenarioTalk103_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_7>Aaah! It's coming again!</ScenarioTalk103_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_8>Somebody, do something!</ScenarioTalk103_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_9>-We've got no choice, but to fight…&#10;What's that? I sense some warm energy…-</ScenarioTalk103_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_10>Arghhh!</ScenarioTalk103_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_11>-The light's vanished, and we opened our eyes. The monster's gone, too.-</ScenarioTalk103_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_12>Hey, it's gone.&#10;Thank goodness… I thought we were gonna die!</ScenarioTalk103_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_13>Hey, you're the one who got us in trouble!</ScenarioTalk103_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_14>Are you telling me that I should just do nothing while a girl's being eaten by a monster?</ScenarioTalk103_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_15>-If no one stops them, they'll just argue all day.-</ScenarioTalk103_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_16>Hey…I'm sorry to interrupt you guys…&#10;But let's talk to her first.&#10;We don’t even know her name. Hey… What's your name?</ScenarioTalk103_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_17>I am Regiana.</ScenarioTalk103_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_18>That's such a nice and unique name!&#10;And you're pretty, just like me!</ScenarioTalk103_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_19>Thank you for helping me.&#10;You saved my life.</ScenarioTalk103_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_20>Don't mention it.&#10;We just did what any Dragon Tamer would have done!</ScenarioTalk103_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_21>Dragon… tamer?</ScenarioTalk103_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_22>That's right, we're Dragon Tamers!&#10;We are the guardians of Yutakan who protect our land with dragons!</ScenarioTalk103_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_23>Oh, I see…&#10;I've never heard of those before…</ScenarioTalk103_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_24>What? You've never heard of Dragon Tamers?&#10;Oh, well, it's our first time here in Berna.</ScenarioTalk103_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_25>I see, so you're not from around here.&#10;I thought the way you all dressed was different.</ScenarioTalk103_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_26>By the way, what's that monster?&#10;It didn't look like a wild animal.</ScenarioTalk103_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk103_2_27>That was…&#10;Some kind of creature that the Black Robes made.&#10;</ScenarioTalk103_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_1>So the Black Robes are doing some dangerous experiments here,&#10;and you're running away from them, right?</ScenarioTalk104_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_2>Yes, that's right.&#10;I was scared that I'd be used for their experiments, so I escaped.</ScenarioTalk104_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_3>Why are they doing it here in Berna of all places?&#10;I guess there are more monsters around here.</ScenarioTalk104_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_4>Darn it, the Black Robes!</ScenarioTalk104_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_5>But don't worry!&#10;We're going to keep you safe!</ScenarioTalk104_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_6>What are you talking about?</ScenarioTalk104_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_7>We're going to protect her!&#10;Aren't we gonna help her? The Black Robes are chasing her.</ScenarioTalk104_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_8>Well, that's true, but…</ScenarioTalk104_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_9>-Zimon is looking at Regiana like he's under some kind of spell.-</ScenarioTalk104_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_10>So you must know where their lab is, right?</ScenarioTalk104_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_11>Yes… but it's too dangerous…</ScenarioTalk104_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_12>Didn't you see? The Black Robes are no match for us!&#10;It's up to us to stop their evil plan!</ScenarioTalk104_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_13>What? Are we gonna take chances without any plan of our own?</ScenarioTalk104_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_14>We don't need a plan.&#10;We can take care of them, just like we did with that monster!</ScenarioTalk104_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_15>-This doesn't feel right.&#10;But if we don't stop them now, no one may be able to.-</ScenarioTalk104_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_16>It looks like a map.&#10;May I see it?</ScenarioTalk104_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_17>We found it on the street…&#10;It's just trash!</ScenarioTalk104_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_18>-Despite Nuri's criticism, I handed over the map.-</ScenarioTalk104_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_19>Hmm… This map…&#10;It's hard to understand, but looks genuine.</ScenarioTalk104_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_20>With this, I may be able to find the way to the place I was captured.&#10;The only thing is…</ScenarioTalk104_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_21>-The only thing?-</ScenarioTalk104_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_22>I'm worried that I'd put you in danger.&#10;Because of me…</ScenarioTalk104_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_23>Ha ha! Don't worry about that!&#10;Nothing can stop Dragon Tamers.</ScenarioTalk104_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_24>Phew…&#10;She sounds like she's already a Grand Master…</ScenarioTalk104_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_25>It's not about your skills, but your passion for justice!&#10;Now, let's go! You, too, Regiana!&#10;The Black Robes, we'll stop whatever you're up to!</ScenarioTalk104_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_26>-Nuri definitely doesn't have a plan at all…&#10;Well, we've got no choice but to go and stop the Black Robes.-</ScenarioTalk104_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_27>Hmmm…This doesn't seem right…</ScenarioTalk104_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_28>-Huh? Zimon is talking to himself.-</ScenarioTalk104_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_29>We came to a strange island because of some weird map.&#10;And we met someone who knows about the Black Robes, who no one else knows about.</ScenarioTalk104_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_30>Don't you see that it's a trap?&#10;We shouldn't trust Regiana.</ScenarioTalk104_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk104_1_31>-His words make me feel confused.Isn't this just a coincidence? If not…-</ScenarioTalk104_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_1>Ugh,&#10;How much further are we gonna go?</ScenarioTalk104_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_2>Are you tired already?&#10;You're more out of shape than you look, jerkface!</ScenarioTalk104_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_3>Hey! What did you call me?</ScenarioTalk104_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_4>Oh, so you can run now?Catch me if you can!&#10;You sorry jerkface!</ScenarioTalk104_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_5>I'll teach you some manners!</ScenarioTalk104_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_6>-We walked for a long time with Regiana showing us the way.&#10;It was such a long and stony road.&#10;It's no wonder Zimon was tired.</ScenarioTalk104_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_7>They seem like they're close friends.&#10;Haha… Ha ha…</ScenarioTalk104_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_8>-Regiana laughed awkwardly whenever Nuri and Zimon argue.&#10;She's not used to them constantly picking on each other.&#10;I have to put up with this nonsense every day, though.-</ScenarioTalk104_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_9>Hey… How much further do we have to go?</ScenarioTalk104_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_10>We're almost there!&#10;Maybe an hour.</ScenarioTalk104_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_11>Another hour? Aaahhh!&#10;Can we take a break?</ScenarioTalk104_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_12>If you're too tired, why don't you rest here? I'm gonna go ahead and see if there's a better path.&#10;I know about this place.</ScenarioTalk104_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_13>Aaaah!&#10;Hey… Get away!</ScenarioTalk104_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_14>-Regiana's running toward us, screaming.</ScenarioTalk104_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_15>Hey… Hey…!&#10;I finally found you. Let's go back… Regiana.</ScenarioTalk104_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_16>No way… You're gonna turn me into a monster!</ScenarioTalk104_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_17>No… That's not happening.&#10;You're not like the others…&#10;But this place is too dangerous. Let's go back.</ScenarioTalk104_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_18>Keep your hands off her!</ScenarioTalk104_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_19>Look who's here…&#10;It's a bunch of punk tamers from Yutakan.</ScenarioTalk104_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_20>What? Punk???&#10;I'll show you!&#10;What are you waiting for? Let's teach him a lesson!</ScenarioTalk104_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_21>-Nuri is looking at me. Hey…&#10;You didn't treat me like this 2 years ago.-</ScenarioTalk104_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_22>Oh~ You're the savior from Yutakan…&#10;But we're not the same Black Robes you knew 2 years ago!&#10;Go! Hybrid Trackers!</ScenarioTalk104_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_23>Wuhhhhh!</ScenarioTalk104_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_24>I can sense both spiritual and mechanical energy!&#10;Isn't it like Dark Frosty?</ScenarioTalk104_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_25>Heh heh… You guessed right.&#10;It's made from the dwarf machine and elf spirit we'd stolen!&#10;</ScenarioTalk104_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_26>I should have combined a dragon as well, but…&#10;This thing is already deadly enough in Berna since it's got less influence from Kades!&#10;You've got no chance in hell!</ScenarioTalk104_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_27>Whatever!&#10;Dragon Tamers! Let's finish them!</ScenarioTalk104_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk104_2_28>-Why does the way she talk remind me of the Black Robes?&#10;As always, I'm the one who has to clean up her mess.-</ScenarioTalk104_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_1>Now, you know.&#10;This is what happens if you dare to challenge Dragon Tamers!</ScenarioTalk105_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_2>Ah, you beat us this time.&#10;But it won't be this easy next time!</ScenarioTalk105_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_3>Ahem. Whatever!&#10;That tired old line doesn't scare us at all!</ScenarioTalk105_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_4>By the way… What's that thing on the ground?</ScenarioTalk105_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_5>-There's some shiny object on the ground.&#10;The Black Robe must have dropped it.-</ScenarioTalk105_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_6>That's called a "Crest."</ScenarioTalk105_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_7>Crest?</ScenarioTalk105_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_8>What's that?</ScenarioTalk105_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_9>A Crest is used to upgrade your dragon.&#10;Just like a Gem, it can increase the Stats of a dragon such as Attack, Defense, and HP.</ScenarioTalk105_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_10>Didn’t you say you'd never seen Dragon Tamer?&#10;You seem to know an awful lot about dragons.</ScenarioTalk105_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_11>I've seen wild dragons many times.&#10;It's only dragons trained by humans I've never seen.</ScenarioTalk105_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_12>Trained? That's an insult to dragons and tamers!&#10;Dragon Tamers are very close to their dragons!</ScenarioTalk105_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_13>-Nuri's got a bit carried away again.&#10;Although Zimon usually argues with her, he's nodding his head this time in agreement.-</ScenarioTalk105_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_14>Right!! That's harsh!</ScenarioTalk105_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_15>I'm sorry… I didn't mean to…</ScenarioTalk105_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_16>-Regiana didn't mean to insult us.&#10;She said she'd never seen Dragon Tamers.-</ScenarioTalk105_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_17>Hm… But… Yeah…&#10;I've got carried away.&#10;I'm sorry for yelling at you.</ScenarioTalk105_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_18>No… It's my fault.&#10;I shouldn't have said that.&#10;I'll be more careful.</ScenarioTalk105_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_19>Well. Let's not dwell on it.&#10;Let's go find the Black Robes.&#10;What will be waiting for us next?</ScenarioTalk105_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_20>-Though Zimon sounded a bit sarcastic,&#10;Regiana didn’t seem to notice it.-</ScenarioTalk105_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_21>Yeah, the lab is this way.</ScenarioTalk105_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk105_1_22>-Again, we followed her.-</ScenarioTalk105_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_1>Look who's here!&#10;What a coincidence, bumping into you guys!</ScenarioTalk106_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_2>Yeah!&#10;What a surprise! I thought you were in the Metal Tower.</ScenarioTalk106_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_3>I'm staying here because of the mining exploration.&#10;It's so good to see you Dragon Tamers!</ScenarioTalk106_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_4>I've never seen her before?&#10;Is she a new tamer?</ScenarioTalk106_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_5>Her name is Regiana.&#10;She's not a tamer. We met her in Berna.</ScenarioTalk106_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_6>N-nice to meet you.&#10;I'm Regiana.</ScenarioTalk106_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_7>You guys met her here?&#10;No humans live in Berna, though.</ScenarioTalk106_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_8>Let me explain.&#10;It's kind of a long story…</ScenarioTalk106_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_9>-I told Arnold what happened.He's not the kind of guy who would take it to the street.-</ScenarioTalk106_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_10>Hmm, so the Black Robes are here…&#10;Wild Imps are all over the place and now, Black Robes…&#10;This is getting serious. We should come up with a plan!</ScenarioTalk106_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_11>Wild Imps?</ScenarioTalk106_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_12>They live in the jungle.&#10;They're not really evil, but they're still a problem.</ScenarioTalk106_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_13>They don't like outsiders being in their territories.&#10;Our exploration is getting delayed because of them.</ScenarioTalk106_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_14>Phew… But they're no match for Dragon Tamers.</ScenarioTalk106_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_15>-Whenever I see Nuri's smile like that, I feel a shiver down my spine.&#10;I know it's my job to take care of them, even though I've never met any Wild Imps.-</ScenarioTalk106_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_16>Bwa ha ha, I always marvel at your confidence!&#10;So, I've got a job for you!</ScenarioTalk106_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_17>Sure! We can handle anything!</ScenarioTalk106_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_18>Ha ha… That's the spirit!&#10;It'd be a piece of cake for you guys!&#10;All you have to do is warn those imps not to interrupt with our work.</ScenarioTalk106_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_19>So you want us to show the head of the Wild Imps who is boss?</ScenarioTalk106_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_20>Yeah, I wanna show them with this hammer…&#10;But I don’t wanna agitate those pointy-eared guys.</ScenarioTalk106_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_21>Are you talking about Elves?&#10;There are Elves here, too?</ScenarioTalk106_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_22>So it's not just a rumor that the Elves and Dwarves are gonna fight again.</ScenarioTalk106_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_23>Well, it's no surprise. They haven't gotten along for ages.&#10;But don't worry as they're not gonna fight.</ScenarioTalk106_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk106_1_24>Help the Dwarves and beat up some Black Robes!&#10;Let's move!&#10;Onward to the jungle of mystery!</ScenarioTalk106_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_1>Oh, you've already beaten them up?!&#10;That's unbelievable. You guys are amazing!&#10;Our mining exploration will go smoothly, thanks to you guys.</ScenarioTalk106_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_2>Well, it's a piece of cake.&#10;Wasn't it, you guys?</ScenarioTalk106_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_3>Y-yeah…&#10;-If I say I did all the work, there'll be no end of it.&#10;I better keep my mouth shut.-</ScenarioTalk106_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_4>Well, I should give you guys some reward…&#10;Tell me what I can do to help.</ScenarioTalk106_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_5>Oh, right! We're looking for the Black Robes!&#10;I totally forgot about it. ;;</ScenarioTalk106_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_6>Hmm… I know my way around here.&#10;I might be able to help you guys.</ScenarioTalk106_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_7>Well… In that case…</ScenarioTalk106_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_8>-Regiana described the place she was captured.-</ScenarioTalk106_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_9>Oh… It sounds like Adel Ruins.</ScenarioTalk106_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_10>Adel Ruins?</ScenarioTalk106_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_11>It's the place where some unknown relics are discovered.&#10;They say it used to be the Altar of Maia or the Temple of Winged Men.&#10;But nothing has been proven yet.</ScenarioTalk106_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_12>Then, there must be a path to get there.</ScenarioTalk106_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_13>Of course, there is.&#10;But not right now.</ScenarioTalk106_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_14>Why is that?</ScenarioTalk106_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_15>I don't know why, but there are Poison Spores all over the place.&#10;Because of them, we can't go in.&#10;If you breathe in the Poison Spores, you'll be paralyzed.</ScenarioTalk106_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_16>Grrr, that's probably the Black Robes' fault!&#10;</ScenarioTalk106_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_17>But if we can't get to their hideout,&#10;what should we do?</ScenarioTalk106_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_18>Well, there's another way.It's not the regular path, but we can still get to Adel Ruins.</ScenarioTalk106_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_19>What? You should've said that earlier!&#10;I thought we'd hit a dead end!&#10;Then, let's go!</ScenarioTalk106_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_20>Hmm… That girl…&#10;Did you say you met her in Berna?</ScenarioTalk106_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_21>She definitely knows Berna well…&#10;And the Adel Ruins are such a remote place… hmm…</ScenarioTalk106_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_22>-Like Zimon, Arnold seems suspicious of Regiana.-</ScenarioTalk106_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_23>Oops, I totally forgot.&#10;I have to go and explore some mines!</ScenarioTalk106_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_24>Wait, you keep talking about mining exploration…&#10;Are we really that short of iron ore that you have to come all the way here to find it?</ScenarioTalk106_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_25>We're not looking for iron ore.&#10;It's Force Stones that we're after.</ScenarioTalk106_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_26>Force Stone?&#10;Is that like a Magic Stone?</ScenarioTalk106_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_27>You can say that. It can be used for the same purpose.&#10;You can use it for keeping monsters out. Well, I better go now. I'll see you guys around.&#10;Let me know if you need my help when you find the Black Robes!</ScenarioTalk106_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_28>Force Stone…&#10;That's why the Elves and Dwarves are here. They're looking for that.&#10;Well, that's easy enough to understand.</ScenarioTalk106_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk106_2_29>All is going according to plan…</ScenarioTalk106_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_1>Phew, that was close!&#10;Look at all the dirt on my clothes!&#10;That path was pretty narrow!</ScenarioTalk107_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_2>Well, no one else is complaining about that.</ScenarioTalk107_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_3>What?&#10;Are you saying I'm fat?</ScenarioTalk107_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_4>I never said that…&#10;You're the one who said it.</ScenarioTalk107_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_5>What? You jerkface!</ScenarioTalk107_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_6>What did you call me?! You fatty!&#10;Well… How can you walk so much but never lose weight?</ScenarioTalk107_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_7>-The way Regiana showed us was a narrow underground path that was barely big enough for one person.&#10;We were covered from head to toe with dirt.</ScenarioTalk107_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_8>-However, we managed to reach Adel Ruins in the end.-</ScenarioTalk107_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_9>Well… I don’t want to interrupt you guys…&#10;But we have to find the Black Robes.</ScenarioTalk107_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_10>Yeah, you're right!&#10;Zimon, this is your lucky day!</ScenarioTalk107_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_11>Hey! Speak for yourself!</ScenarioTalk107_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_12>Bah!&#10;Regiana, let's leave that jerkface here and go with me!</ScenarioTalk107_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_13>Oh… Okay…</ScenarioTalk107_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_14>-Nuri angrily started walking ahead of us with Regiana.&#10;Zimon was seriously looking at their backs.-</ScenarioTalk107_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_15>Hey, shouldn't we go, too?</ScenarioTalk107_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_16>The more I think of it, the stranger it seems…</ScenarioTalk107_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_17>What do you mean?</ScenarioTalk107_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_18>It's like déjà vu all over again…&#10;How does Regiana know about this path?</ScenarioTalk107_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_19>Because she was captured by the Black Robes.</ScenarioTalk107_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_20>Do you think that's why?&#10;What if that's not really the case?</ScenarioTalk107_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_21>Not really the case?&#10;What do you mean?</ScenarioTalk107_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk107_1_22>I'm just thinking out loud.&#10;Let's keep moving. We shouldn't let Nuri mess up again.</ScenarioTalk107_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_1>This is where I escaped!</ScenarioTalk107_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_2>Hmm, there's nothing here???&#10;They might have already evacuated.</ScenarioTalk107_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_3>Oh, here you are, Regiana.&#10;We've been looking for you.</ScenarioTalk107_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_4>Ahhh…</ScenarioTalk107_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_5>Let's leave the past behind us and go back.&#10;You're a good girl, Regiana, aren't you?</ScenarioTalk107_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_6>…</ScenarioTalk107_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_7>No way she's going back!&#10;Regiana, don't worry! We'll keep you safe!</ScenarioTalk107_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_8>You again?&#10;Mind your own business. This is a family matter.</ScenarioTalk107_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_9>-When the Black Robe signaled with his hand, a huge monster showed up from the back of the ruins.&#10;It looks more vicious than the ones we fought before.-</ScenarioTalk107_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_10>Grrr…</ScenarioTalk107_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_11>This… is… nothing. You can't scare us with that.&#10;Regiana, get back!</ScenarioTalk107_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_12>Grrr!</ScenarioTalk107_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk107_2_13>Ahh!</ScenarioTalk107_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_1>Grrr!</ScenarioTalk108_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_2>-The sharp noise it made echoed off the rocks in the ruins.&#10;When the monster fell on the ground, the echoing stopped.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_3>Phew…&#10;That was close. That was terrifying…</ScenarioTalk108_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_4>Hey, they got Nuri!</ScenarioTalk108_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_5>I'm sorry, guys.</ScenarioTalk108_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_6>You sneaky bastard!</ScenarioTalk108_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_7>I didn’t want to go this far!&#10;Now, hand Regiana over to us!&#10;If you don't want us to kill this girl!</ScenarioTalk108_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_8>-The Black Robe yelled at us, holding a dagger at Nuri's throat.&#10;I looked at Nuri and Regiana.&#10;How can we save Nuri?-</ScenarioTalk108_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_9>-Seeing me hesitate, his smile slowly spread across his face.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_10>-In that moment!-</ScenarioTalk108_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_11>Ahh! An a-arrow…&#10;Darn, it's an ambush…</ScenarioTalk108_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_12>-An arrow shot out of nowhere and hit the Black Robe on the shoulder.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_13> -Nuri got away from the Black Robe&#10;who ran away seeing his disadvantage.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_14>Hey, long time, no see.&#10;Did anybody get hurt?</ScenarioTalk108_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_15>Thank goodness! You guys look okay.&#10;I've never seen you before.</ScenarioTalk108_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_16>Thanks for the help.&#10;This is Regiana.</ScenarioTalk108_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_17> So, Florence, what're you doing here?</ScenarioTalk108_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_18>It's a long story…&#10;I'll cut to the chase.&#10;We have to go to Elysium.</ScenarioTalk108_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_19>Elysium?&#10;So, Aidra needs something?</ScenarioTalk108_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_20>You're quick.&#10;Yes, Aidra is looking for you guys.&#10;That's why I am here.</ScenarioTalk108_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_21>-Florence's sudden appearance must mean something happened.&#10;So Aidra is looking for us… Why now of all times?-</ScenarioTalk108_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_22>Can you tell me why they sent you all the way to Berna?</ScenarioTalk108_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_23>I'm just the messenger.&#10;You have to go and see her in Elysium.</ScenarioTalk108_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_24>Hmm… There seem to be no more Black Robes here.&#10;Let's go find out what it is?</ScenarioTalk108_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_25>That's a good idea.-It's gotta be something important.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_26>Thank you.&#10;Now, let's go right away.&#10;This way…</ScenarioTalk108_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_27>Huh?</ScenarioTalk108_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_28>Who's there!?</ScenarioTalk108_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_29>-Florence turned around and aimed with her bow.&#10;Then, pieces of relic fell on the ground from the wind.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_30>-After looking around the area with her sharp gaze, she slowly lowered her bow.-</ScenarioTalk108_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_31>What happened?</ScenarioTalk108_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_32>It's nothing.&#10;I got distracted. Let's go.</ScenarioTalk108_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk108_1_33>They are as good as I expected, except an Elf.&#10;But it doesn't matter. The outcome will be the same.</ScenarioTalk108_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_1>.-Following Florence, we got on board the ship heading toward the main base of the Elves.&#10;With the wind at our backs, we quickly reached our destination.-</ScenarioTalk109_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_2>May the blessing of the spirits be with you.&#10;Travelers, welcome to Elysium</ScenarioTalk109_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_3>Hey! There are monsters here.</ScenarioTalk109_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_4>Monsters?&#10;Isn't Elysium protected by Magic Stones?</ScenarioTalk109_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_5>Lately, we've been short on Magic Stones and can't protect all of Elysium.&#10;So, the protection for other areas except the town is rather weak.</ScenarioTalk109_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_6>Is there anything we can do to help?</ScenarioTalk109_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk109_1_7>We'd appreciate it.&#10;Can you patrol the surrounding areas?&#10;I'm gonna head to the King's Castle and let them know you're here.</ScenarioTalk109_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_1>Hey! Look!&#10;The monsters came through here!</ScenarioTalk109_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_2>-We checked the condition of the Sanctuary while going around Elysium and clearing monsters.&#10;Finally, we came across the crack in the Sanctuary.&#10;It was more like a big hole.-</ScenarioTalk109_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_3>What's that? It doesn't look like the Sanctuary was weakened.&#10;It's been destroyed.</ScenarioTalk109_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_4>Heh heh, so you found it.&#10;But there's nothing you can do about it!</ScenarioTalk109_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_5>Hey, it's the Black Robes!</ScenarioTalk109_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_6>You again?&#10;What did you do to the Sanctuary?</ScenarioTalk109_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_7>I wanted to check how strong it was.&#10;All I did was touch it, and it broke. Heh heh…</ScenarioTalk109_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_8>That's a lie!&#10;The Sanctuary can't be broken that easily!</ScenarioTalk109_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_9>Sure, but it's still possible.&#10;If its energy is low, it can be broken easily.</ScenarioTalk109_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_10>So you know something after all?&#10;Seeing as you're still in that egg shell, you're smarter than you look.</ScenarioTalk109_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk109_2_11>What? Egg shell?&#10;Hey! Let's peel off that black shell of his!</ScenarioTalk109_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_1>Grr, I've got beaten by a chick in an egg shell…</ScenarioTalk110_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_2>What? A chick?&#10;I'll teach you a lesson how scary a chick can be!</ScenarioTalk110_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_3>Oh… He's really angry now.&#10;Zimon, calm down.</ScenarioTalk110_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_4>Is everyone okay?&#10;Ah, you're a Black Robe!</ScenarioTalk110_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_5>-Florence arrived at the site with the guards.&#10;When she saw the Black Robe, she took out her bow and aimed it at him.</ScenarioTalk110_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_6>It's you!&#10;Say your last words!</ScenarioTalk110_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_7>Hmpf, I'll let you live this time.</ScenarioTalk110_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_8>-The Black Robe jumped into the crack on the Sanctuary.&#10;When he left, the crack disappeared.-</ScenarioTalk110_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_9>Phew… Thank goodness we found him before more monsters could get in.&#10;I can't imagine what would have happened…&#10;It'd be devastating.</ScenarioTalk110_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_10>Are you really short on Magic Stones?&#10;The Black Robes are even breaking into the Sanctuary.</ScenarioTalk110_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_11>I'll explain that.</ScenarioTalk110_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_12>Your Majesty!</ScenarioTalk110_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_13>It is nice to meet you in a long time.But the situation is not good.</ScenarioTalk110_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_14>The Magic Stones we produced in Elysium are almost gone.&#10;If this continues, the Elves will be exhausted by their fight with the Dwarves and be defeated.</ScenarioTalk110_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_15>Then, it'd be a serious problem.</ScenarioTalk110_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_16>Yes. But fortunately, we heard that&#10;Magic Stones can be replaced by Force Stones that can be found in Berna.</ScenarioTalk110_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_17>Elven scientists such as Berutaon are working on it,&#10;and they found out that Force Stones can be used to protect the Sanctuary.</ScenarioTalk110_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_18>Oh, then, Elysium can become safe again?</ScenarioTalk110_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_19>That's right, but only if we can get enough Force Stones.&#10;Then, we won't have any more monsters lurking around.</ScenarioTalk110_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_20>Oh, I heard that Dwarves are looking for Force Stones, too.&#10;Hey! Why'd you step on my foot?</ScenarioTalk110_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_21>Do you want a war between the Dwarves and Elves?&#10;They don't like each other already, and now, they want the same thing.</ScenarioTalk110_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_22>-Aidra was taken aback by the word "Dwarves,"&#10;but she continued.-</ScenarioTalk110_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_23>We know the Dwarves are looking for Force Stones in Berna.&#10;In fact, that's why I brought you here.</ScenarioTalk110_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_24>We don't want to fight the Dwarves.&#10;We only need Force Stones.&#10;I think the Dwarves feel the same way.</ScenarioTalk110_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_25>We want to form a peace treaty with the Dwarves.&#10;I'd like you to go and meet the Dwarves and see if they'll accept the treaty.</ScenarioTalk110_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_26>Absolutely, yes. That's what we'll do.&#10;Preventing a war is our job, right?</ScenarioTalk110_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_27>That's not that simple, is it!?&#10;</ScenarioTalk110_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_28>If not us, who else?&#10;The Dwarves and Elves can't exactly visit each other.</ScenarioTalk110_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_29>Then, I will leave it to you guys.&#10;May the blessing of the wind be with you.</ScenarioTalk110_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_30>Florence, who's that girl? I've never seen her before.</ScenarioTalk110_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_31>She's the girl they met in Berna.&#10;Her name is Regiana.&#10;She escaped from the Black Robes.</ScenarioTalk110_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_32>In Berna?&#10;I thought there weren't any humans in Berna.</ScenarioTalk110_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_33>Yes, as far as we know, there are no humans living in Berna.</ScenarioTalk110_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_34>Hmm… What about the expedition we were going to send to Berna?</ScenarioTalk110_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_35>It's ready now.&#10;We can start any time.</ScenarioTalk110_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_36>I see.&#10;Florence, I'm gonna give you a new mission.</ScenarioTalk110_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_37>A new mission?</ScenarioTalk110_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_38>First, go to Berna and watch out for them.&#10;Keep an eye on the girl.</ScenarioTalk110_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk110_1_39>Sure!</ScenarioTalk110_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_1>Ah… You are not allowed to get in.&#10;Borutus said no.</ScenarioTalk111_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_2>-We got to the Metal Tower shortly to deliver the message.&#10;But we couldn’t pass the gate.-</ScenarioTalk111_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_3>After everything we've done for you guys!?&#10;You can't treat us like this!&#10;This is very important!</ScenarioTalk111_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_4>No means no.&#10;You helped us a lot over the years, but this is a different matter.</ScenarioTalk111_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_5>What's all this fuss?</ScenarioTalk111_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_6>-With the gruff voice, Borutus opened the gate,&#10;and came out!-</ScenarioTalk111_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_7>Dogi, what's going on?</ScenarioTalk111_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_8>-I told him about the peace treaty the Elves were offering.-</ScenarioTalk111_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_9>Haha. So the pointy ears are offering a peace treaty?&#10;I'd rather go to war against them than trust them!</ScenarioTalk111_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_10>If you keep making a fuss in front of my castle,&#10;I'll teach you a lesson with my axe! Get out of my sight!</ScenarioTalk111_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_11>I'm not here to talk to you.&#10;I wanna speak to Srorin!</ScenarioTalk111_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_12>Watch your mouth, you little squirrel!&#10;I'm gonna teach you some manners!</ScenarioTalk111_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_13>-Just when they were getting serious,&#10;a soldier approached Dogi and said something to him.-</ScenarioTalk111_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_14>What? There're monsters where Srorin stays?</ScenarioTalk111_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_15>What? We have to go right away!&#10;What are you waiting for? Let's move!</ScenarioTalk111_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_16>-As soon as Borutus learned that the king was in danger,&#10;he left the kingdom right away and seemed to forget about us.-</ScenarioTalk111_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_17>Hey! That shorty left us without saying anything!&#10;Grrr!!! I'm so angry!!!</ScenarioTalk111_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_18>Calm down…&#10;We can meet Srorin if we follow them.</ScenarioTalk111_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_19>Yes, that's right.&#10;Let's go find Srorin first and show how useless that guy is.&#10;He'll lose his job in no time!</ScenarioTalk111_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_20>Hey… I didn't mean that…</ScenarioTalk111_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_21>Okay! Let's find Srorin before they do!&#10;Let's move!</ScenarioTalk111_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk111_1_22>-Nuri's eyes were lit up with the fire of vengeance…</ScenarioTalk111_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk111_2_1>Argh! Where is he?</ScenarioTalk111_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk111_2_2>The Metal Tower is too big. It's like finding a needle&#10;in a haystack. Don't you think so?</ScenarioTalk111_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk111_2_3>Well, I don't! We have to pay Borutus back for insulting us!</ScenarioTalk111_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk111_2_4>Eh? I hear someone fighting over there!</ScenarioTalk111_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk111_2_5>Oh! There he is!&#10;Wait, Borutus! I'll make you pay for what you did!!</ScenarioTalk111_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk111_2_6>-Zimon and I followed her, shaking our heads.-</ScenarioTalk111_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_1>What is this?&#10;Who are you?</ScenarioTalk112_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_2>Krrr…</ScenarioTalk112_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_3>Hey! Go back to where you came from!&#10;Is anybody out there?</ScenarioTalk112_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_4>Krrr… Arghh!</ScenarioTalk112_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_5>Stop it, you monster!</ScenarioTalk112_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_6>-After searching every nook and cranny of the Metal Tower, we finally found King Srorin.&#10;He was being attacked by monsters, but no one was protecting him.-</ScenarioTalk112_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_7>Oh, you're the Dragon Tamers from Elpis!What brings you here?</ScenarioTalk112_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_8>We have something important to tell you.&#10;First things first, though. Let's take care of this monster.</ScenarioTalk112_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_9>Krrr…</ScenarioTalk112_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_10>Hmm&#10;Hey, that's the monster we saw in Berna.</ScenarioTalk112_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_11>Eh… That's the same monster.&#10;The Black Robes must have unleashed those monsters here!</ScenarioTalk112_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_12>We beat them once, and we'll beat them again.&#10;Let's finish them! Hey, come on!</ScenarioTalk112_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk112_1_13>Hold on…&#10;We didn't beat them fair and square last time.</ScenarioTalk112_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_1>Krrr…</ScenarioTalk112_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_2>This thing's really stubborn… It's still alive!</ScenarioTalk112_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_3>Okay, I'll finish it myself!</ScenarioTalk112_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_4>Argh!</ScenarioTalk112_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_5>Ahh!&#10;How dare you…?</ScenarioTalk112_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_6>It's dangerous, King Srorin!</ScenarioTalk112_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_7>-The monster looked like it was dying, but it got up and jumped onto the king.&#10;Suddenly, this bright light came out of nowhere.&#10;It's the same thing we saw in Berna!-</ScenarioTalk112_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_8>-The monster ran away growling. The King was safe now.&#10;King Srorin took a bow and expressed his gratitude.-</ScenarioTalk112_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_9>Once again, I am greatly indebted to you.Thank you for saving my life.</ScenarioTalk112_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_10>Don't mention it!&#10;We just did what we had to do.</ScenarioTalk112_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_11>What’s up with that light again?Didn’t we see the same light in Berna?</ScenarioTalk112_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_12>What light?&#10;I haven’t seen any light.</ScenarioTalk112_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_13>Ha…&#10;Maybe it was foolish of me to ask you that.</ScenarioTalk112_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_14>You said you’ve got something important to tell me.Let’s hear it.</ScenarioTalk112_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_15>Yes!&#10;The queen of Elysium wants to make a peace treaty with the Metal Tower.&#10;We came here to deliver the message.</ScenarioTalk112_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_16>Oh, Aidra’s offering a peace treaty?</ScenarioTalk112_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_17>Your highness!&#10;Are you okay?</ScenarioTalk112_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_18>Oh, there you are.&#10;As you can see, I’m fine.</ScenarioTalk112_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_19>Thank goodness.&#10;Hey, are you still trying to get inside my castle…</ScenarioTalk112_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_20>Listen, Dragon Tamers.&#10;I accept your peace treaty.</ScenarioTalk112_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_21>Your highness, we shouldn’t trust those pointy ears!&#10;They are probably scheming behind our back.</ScenarioTalk112_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_22>Watch your mouth, Borutus!&#10;Although they are our enemy, she’s the queen and leader of a kingdom.&#10;Personally, she’s my childhood friend.</ScenarioTalk112_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_23>Oh… I supposed I got carried away and spoke out of turn.Forgive me, your highness.</ScenarioTalk112_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_24>Hmm, I’ll overlook this time.&#10;But you have to go to Elysium and sign the peace treaty.</ScenarioTalk112_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_25>Eh? Me?</ScenarioTalk112_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_26>You don’t wanna go?&#10;Should I find someone more loyal?</ScenarioTalk112_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk112_2_27>No… your highness.&#10;I’ll do as you say.</ScenarioTalk112_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_1>-After completing the mission, we decided to go back to Berna.&#10;Under the order of the king, Chief Guard Dogi escorted us to Berna.&#10;After arriving on the island, we got some rest at the Dwarf’s base.-</ScenarioTalk113_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_2>Ha ha! Did you see how Borutus trembled before the king?&#10;That was so cool. Don't you agree? Huh?</ScenarioTalk113_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_3>S-sure.&#10;-I enjoyed it, but he’s not really a bad guy.&#10;I didn’t want to laugh at him.-</ScenarioTalk113_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_4>What’s next?&#10;Our job as a messenger is done, right?</ScenarioTalk113_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_5>It seems so.&#10;Bringing peace between the Elves and Dwarves!&#10;Maybe we'll show up in a history book or something.</ScenarioTalk113_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_6>Hey, don’t get too excited. You sound like those Dwarves.&#10;Why don’t we finish the job first?</ScenarioTalk113_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_7>Bad news!&#10;Arnold… Arnold…</ScenarioTalk113_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_8>What’s the matter, Dogi?</ScenarioTalk113_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_9>Arnold is missing!&#10;We have to send the message from our King Srorin…</ScenarioTalk113_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_10>Arnold is missing…?&#10;When’s the last time you saw him?</ScenarioTalk113_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_11>They say he’s heading toward the highland in the North.&#10;Near the borderline of the Elf side. If he’s really missing,&#10;It will jeopardize our peace treaty.</ScenarioTalk113_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_12>What about my place in the history books?</ScenarioTalk113_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_13>What? What're you talking about?</ScenarioTalk113_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_14>Don’t mind! We’ve got no time to lose!&#10;Let’s go find Arnold.</ScenarioTalk113_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_15>A highland in the North probably means the Highland Baha.</ScenarioTalk113_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_16>Highland Baha?</ScenarioTalk113_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_17>It’s the highland right under Mt. Icecap.&#10;It serves as a bridge that connects to Berna, which is blocked by the Central Lake.</ScenarioTalk113_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_18>Is it safe to travel up there?&#10;I have no idea what it’s like since this is my first time here.</ScenarioTalk113_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_19>When I went up there, I saw some mysterious creatures.&#10;But now I have no idea.&#10;It was a long time ago…</ScenarioTalk113_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk113_1_20>Let’s go to that highland.&#10;We’ll figure out a way!</ScenarioTalk113_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk114_1_1>So is this Highland Baha?</ScenarioTalk114_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk114_1_2>It’s rather cold…</ScenarioTalk114_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk114_1_3>Because of its high altitude, it’s freezing up here.&#10;We're close to Mt. Icecap over there.</ScenarioTalk114_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk114_1_4>Now, let’s go find Arnold!&#10;There must be some trace he left behind!</ScenarioTalk114_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_1>-When we arrived in Highland Baha, we started looking for traces of Arnold.&#10; After searching for a long time, we managed to find some traces in a place overlooking a deep forest.-</ScenarioTalk114_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_2>Oh, this may be it!</ScenarioTalk114_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_3>What did you find?</ScenarioTalk114_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_4>Hey, look!&#10;Isn't this Arnold's gear?</ScenarioTalk114_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_5>Hmm, this looks about right.&#10;These gloves and backpack… They're certainly his.</ScenarioTalk114_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_6>That means he’s here somewhere, right?</ScenarioTalk114_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_7>Hmm… Maybe not.&#10;That bonfire looks like it’s used a couple of days ago…</ScenarioTalk114_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_8>Where did he go without his gear?</ScenarioTalk114_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_9>Hey, be careful!</ScenarioTalk114_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_10>Krrr!</ScenarioTalk114_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_11>That… That’s Dark Frosty!</ScenarioTalk114_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk114_2_12>It looks more vicious than before!</ScenarioTalk114_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_1>Krrr!</ScenarioTalk115_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_2>Phew, that was close.&#10;What in the world is Dark Frosty doing up here?</ScenarioTalk115_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_3>I bet it’s the Black Robes.&#10;It seems it’s still alive…</ScenarioTalk115_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_4>No reason to kill it, though…</ScenarioTalk115_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_5>Sniff, sniff! What’s this fishy smell?&#10;Hey! Zimon, be careful!</ScenarioTalk115_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_6>Eh? What?&#10;Aaaahhhhh!</ScenarioTalk115_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_7>Oww!</ScenarioTalk115_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_8>No, Zimon!</ScenarioTalk115_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_9>-The Dark Frosty that fell on the ground suddenly exploded with smoke.&#10;Covered with smoke, we were paralyzed and fell on the ground.-</ScenarioTalk115_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_10>Haha, the Poison Spores work like a charm.&#10;We managed to recycle that piece of junk and make good use out of it!</ScenarioTalk115_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_11>Now, let’s see what we’ve got here.</ScenarioTalk115_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_12>Z-Zimon…</ScenarioTalk115_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_13>-I heard Nuri's faint voice.&#10;But I couldn’t move, not even a finger.-</ScenarioTalk115_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_14>Ah ha, there you are.&#10;Now, let’s bring them up here.</ScenarioTalk115_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_15>Let’s see…&#10;Eh?</ScenarioTalk115_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_16>Hey, it’s you!</ScenarioTalk115_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_17>Take this.</ScenarioTalk115_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_18>Kaahh!</ScenarioTalk115_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_19>Hey, guys!</ScenarioTalk115_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_20>…</ScenarioTalk115_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_21>Who… Who is it?</ScenarioTalk115_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_22>…</ScenarioTalk115_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk115_1_23>-Barely holding onto consciousness, I saw something.&#10;Those two bright red eyes…-</ScenarioTalk115_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_1>-When I opened my eyes again, I found myself lying on a bed in some strange tent.&#10;I felt dizzy and a sharp pain in my head when I tried to get up.-</ScenarioTalk116_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_2>-I got up and looked around. I saw Regiana sleeping next to the bed.There was a bowl with aqua in it and a wet towel.-</ScenarioTalk116_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_3>Did she take care of me?</ScenarioTalk116_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_4>Oh, you're awake!</ScenarioTalk116_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_5>-She woke up from the sound I made. She smiled at me.-</ScenarioTalk116_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_6>This is the base of the Elves in Berna.&#10;You’ve been unconscious for a couple of days since we got here.</ScenarioTalk116_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_7>Base of the Elves?&#10;Then, the army of Elves are in Berna? Ahh!</ScenarioTalk116_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_8>You should stay calm.&#10;Although we managed to detoxicate you, there might be some poison left in you.</ScenarioTalk116_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_9>Poison Spores?&#10;Then, the smoke was…</ScenarioTalk116_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_10>Yes, the Dark Frosty discharged it as it exploded.&#10;If Florence didn’t arrive on time, we must have been in big trouble.&#10;</ScenarioTalk116_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_11>I’m glad I could help.&#10;I'm used to treat wounds, so…</ScenarioTalk116_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_12>Used to?</ScenarioTalk116_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_13>I took care of the animals injured during the experiments.&#10;The Black Robes made me do it, saying that I was good at it.</ScenarioTalk116_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_14>I knew they would take them back to the lab when they recovered.&#10;Knowing that they would be used for experiments, I felt…</ScenarioTalk116_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_15>-She looked sad as she was thinking about the lab and her experience there.&#10;I changed the subject.-</ScenarioTalk116_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_16>Are you okay, by the way?&#10;Didn’t you get hurt?</ScenarioTalk116_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_17>Oh, I’m okay.&#10;I got some scratches… but it’s okay now.</ScenarioTalk116_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_18>That’s good to hear.</ScenarioTalk116_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_19>Thank you.&#10;No one's ever worried about me like that before.</ScenarioTalk116_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_20>-Regiana blushed and smiled awkwardly.&#10;What kind of life did she live?-</ScenarioTalk116_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_21>Hey, you’re awake!</ScenarioTalk116_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_22>Arnold, you’re alive!</ScenarioTalk116_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_23>What’re you saying!?&#10;Dwarves can't die in a place like this.</ScenarioTalk116_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_24>I’ll go outside.&#10;You guys talk.</ScenarioTalk116_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_25>Hrm… Rescued by Elves…&#10;They say they saved me because of some peace treaty.</ScenarioTalk116_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_26>Yes. Aidra and Srorin decided to sign a peace treaty.&#10;There won’t be a war between the Elves and Dwarves in Berna.</ScenarioTalk116_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_27>Hmm, I see. Well, we just have to follow their decisions.&#10;It’s good that there’s no war.&#10;Hey, I’ve got something to tell you.</ScenarioTalk116_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_28>-Arnold told me why he went to Highland Baha and what he learned there.-</ScenarioTalk116_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_29>So you’re looking for the connection between the Black Robes and Poison Spores.</ScenarioTalk116_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_30>That’s right.&#10;When you told me you saw the Black Robes, it hit me.&#10;So I did some research.</ScenarioTalk116_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_31>If that’s what you’re after, you could’ve asked Regiana…</ScenarioTalk116_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_32>Well…</ScenarioTalk116_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_33>I can’t rely on the words from someone we don’t trust yet.&#10;Isn’t it obvious?</ScenarioTalk116_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_34>Ah, you startled me! When did you come in??&#10;By the way, are you still suspicious of Regiana?</ScenarioTalk116_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_35>I don’t think she’s a bad sort.&#10;I have a sneaking suspicion, though.</ScenarioTalk116_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_36>Hey, speaking straightforward like that, you’re putting me in an awkward position.</ScenarioTalk116_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_37>Is it more awkward, being a grownup and getting lost?</ScenarioTalk116_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_38>What do you mean by lost?&#10;I just got carried away by my research!</ScenarioTalk116_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_39>-With his ears turning red, Arnold raised his voice.&#10;Letting them arguing over nothing, I thought over the things that happened to us in the last few days.</ScenarioTalk116_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_40>-A man with red eyes, a treasure map, strange monsters, Black Robes,&#10;Elysium, Metal Tower, cracks in the Sanctuary, Dark Frosty and Poison Spores…"</ScenarioTalk116_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk116_1_41>-All these things happening just can't be a coincidence.&#10;What exactly is behind all of this?&#10;The mystery of Berna? Force Stones? If not, maybe…-</ScenarioTalk116_1_41>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_1>Are you okay now?&#10;You didn’t get hurt so bad in the first place. We've got things to discuss!</ScenarioTalk117_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_2>What more needs to be done?&#10;Our job was finished when we delivered the message.</ScenarioTalk117_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_3>No!&#10;It’s not enough to get on the history books!&#10;We’ve gotta do something more!</ScenarioTalk117_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_4>Nuri, I know you’re busy and sorry to bother you, but…&#10;I have to ask you something.</ScenarioTalk117_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_5>Ha ha, I’m not busy.;&#10;What’s up?</ScenarioTalk117_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_6>-Florence showed us a scroll.-</ScenarioTalk117_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_7>Is this the treasure map you were talking about?</ScenarioTalk117_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_8>-It has exactly the same map on it.-</ScenarioTalk117_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_9>What’s this map?</ScenarioTalk117_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_10>We found this map on one of the Black Robes in Highland Baha.</ScenarioTalk117_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_11>Highland Baha?&#10;The place we blacked out?</ScenarioTalk117_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_12>Yes, when I got there, someone had already got him.&#10;Did nobody see it?</ScenarioTalk117_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_13>No, I only remember the Dark Frosty.&#10;Do you remember anything?</ScenarioTalk117_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_14>No, me neither.</ScenarioTalk117_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_15>Now that I think about it, there seemed to be someone other than the Dark Frosty…</ScenarioTalk117_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_16>The Black Robe was stabbed by someone.&#10;With one hit… It’s likely to be a highly skilled assassin.</ScenarioTalk117_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_17>No one here has skill like that.</ScenarioTalk117_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_18>The three of us don’t.&#10;But what about Regiana…?</ScenarioTalk117_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_19>Zimon, you still…!</ScenarioTalk117_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_20>Now I remember! Red eyes!</ScenarioTalk117_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_21>Red eyes?</ScenarioTalk117_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_22>Yes, it was the red eyes I saw in Elpis!&#10;He dropped this map!</ScenarioTalk117_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_23>So he’s the one who killed the Black Robe.&#10;But you don’t know who he is, right?</ScenarioTalk117_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_24>That’s right…</ScenarioTalk117_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_25>That means the guy led us into this mess.&#10;What would be his motive?</ScenarioTalk117_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_26>Then, we’re certain that it’s not Regiana?</ScenarioTalk117_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_27>Maybe…</ScenarioTalk117_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_28>-I looked at the map.&#10;The map of Berna and some small unknown letters are displayed in the scroll.-</ScenarioTalk117_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_29>Hey, what are these letters?&#10;The other map doesn’t have any writing like this.</ScenarioTalk117_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_30>What letters?&#10;Oh, you’re right.</ScenarioTalk117_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_31>I’ve never seen these.</ScenarioTalk117_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_32>I was wondering about them myself.&#10;How about we ask Berutaon about this?&#10;He’s here to work on the Force Stones.</ScenarioTalk117_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_33>Oh, the scholar was here in Berna?</ScenarioTalk117_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk117_1_34>He stopped by to collect some samples.&#10;He may be in Forest Hana now.&#10;Since it can be dangerous, let’s go together.</ScenarioTalk117_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_1>Forest Hana is nothing like Imp Jungle.&#10;Imp Jungle was kind of dreary, but it’s very clean and bright here.</ScenarioTalk117_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_2>It’s like being in Elysium.&#10;But the trees are so dense that you might get lost unless you are an Elf.</ScenarioTalk117_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_3>Right. There are many dangerous wild animals.&#10;It’s not a good place to stay very long.</ScenarioTalk117_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_4>We’ve been walking for ages. I’m exhausted.&#10;Where is Berutaon?</ScenarioTalk117_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_5>Let me go ahead and search.&#10;You guys get some rest.</ScenarioTalk117_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_6>-Florence went ahead and got out of our sight quickly.-</ScenarioTalk117_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_7>What would you do if Regiana is a spy working for the Black Robes?</ScenarioTalk117_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_8>You, too?&#10;There’s no way Regiana is a spy.&#10;She even led us to the Black Robe’s lab.</ScenarioTalk117_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_9>I said if!&#10;What if she’s been hiding it?&#10;She might be looking for something big.</ScenarioTalk117_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_10>Then, we have to prepare for the worst-case scenario.</ScenarioTalk117_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_11>I said no way!&#10;What does the word “friend” mean to you?</ScenarioTalk117_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_12>-Listening to their talk, there are so many things on my mind.&#10;Regiana who got chased and who showed the way,&#10;and took care of me… We haven’t known her for a long time, but it’s enough.-</ScenarioTalk117_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_13>Yes, I trust her.&#10;Though there are things suspicious, like Zimon said.</ScenarioTalk117_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_14>I think she’s our friend, even more than that.</ScenarioTalk117_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_15>Of course, if she’s deceiving us…&#10;I won’t forgive her.</ScenarioTalk117_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk117_2_16>We found Berutaon.&#10;He’s with Regiana. Let’s go.</ScenarioTalk117_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_1>Here you are.&#10;Regiana was searching for herbs for you.&#10;So I was helping her.</ScenarioTalk118_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_2>She knows this place very well.&#10;It was very helpful.</ScenarioTalk118_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_3>No…&#10;I got more help from you.</ScenarioTalk118_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_4>Ha ha! Is that so?&#10;Say what’s on your mind, Zimon.</ScenarioTalk118_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_5>-Zimon was frowning and didn’t say a word.-</ScenarioTalk118_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_6>Berutaon, can you tell us about the map I showed you?</ScenarioTalk118_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_7>These are Deva Letters.</ScenarioTalk118_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_8>Deva Letters?</ScenarioTalk118_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_9>They are the ancient letters of Winged Men.&#10;We need some kind of a potion to translate them. This is magical writing, after all.</ScenarioTalk118_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_10>Potion?</ScenarioTalk118_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_11>Yes, but we need some ingredients to make the potion.</ScenarioTalk118_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_12>Maybe we can find some ingredients around here.&#10;Would you mind?</ScenarioTalk118_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_13>Of course not!&#10;Let us know what you need!</ScenarioTalk118_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk118_1_14>I’m gonna write them down here.&#10;I’ll wait for you at the base.</ScenarioTalk118_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk118_2_1>That’s everything we need!</ScenarioTalk118_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk118_2_2>It looked peaceful from a distance.&#10;But it’s exhausting once you're here.</ScenarioTalk118_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk118_2_3>It’s like we’ve been circling around for ages.&#10;And so many wild animals!</ScenarioTalk118_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk118_2_4>Now I understand why there’re no monsters around. The animals are bad enough.</ScenarioTalk118_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk118_2_5>Let’s go back! To the base!</ScenarioTalk118_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_1>-When we arrived at Berutaon’s ledge, we handed the ingredients to him.&#10;He skillfully mixed the ingredients and created a potion.-</ScenarioTalk119_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_2>Now, we apply this potion to the map.</ScenarioTalk119_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_3>-Berutaon dropped some potion on the map.&#10;Then, the letters illuminated in blue light and rose into the air.-</ScenarioTalk119_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_4>Let's see…&#10;Hmm… This is quite interesting.</ScenarioTalk119_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_5>What does it say?</ScenarioTalk119_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_6>It's the plan to wake the Avatar of Rajhid.</ScenarioTalk119_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_7>Rajhid…&#10;One of the five Decons?</ScenarioTalk119_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_8>Maybe so.</ScenarioTalk119_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_9>It's nice to see you be so calm and collected about it.</ScenarioTalk119_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_10>It's just a plan, isn't?&#10;Seeing some of the ingredients…</ScenarioTalk119_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_11>Red moss, ash, dead wood, spider web…&#10;It's a long list, but you can get all of them.</ScenarioTalk119_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_12>Yes, then, it's pretty dangerous, isn't it?</ScenarioTalk119_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_13>I'm just reading what it says.</ScenarioTalk119_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_14>If you can get these things, how come they've never awakened him?&#10;That means this won't work, right?</ScenarioTalk119_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_15>If the Black Robes have that map, what it says may be true, right?&#10;Maybe there's something in the list that's hard to find.</ScenarioTalk119_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_16>You can't rely on that map from the Black Robe.&#10;He might have just picked it up from the ground.</ScenarioTalk119_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_17>Who was the fool that went to find treasure with a map he found on the ground?</ScenarioTalk119_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_18>What? Fool?What did you call me?You, stop right there!</ScenarioTalk119_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_19>Well, there's one thing that is hard to find.&#10;It's the fresh blood of someone who sealed himself.</ScenarioTalk119_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_20>Fresh… blood?</ScenarioTalk119_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_21>-Regiana's face turned pale all of a sudden.&#10;She was trembling like she's in severe shock.-</ScenarioTalk119_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_22>Hey, Regiana, are you okay?&#10;You look pale…</ScenarioTalk119_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_23>I… I am…</ScenarioTalk119_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_24>-Before we even asked her why, she passed out.-</ScenarioTalk119_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_25>Gosh… She must've been very tired.&#10;I think she's exhausted.</ScenarioTalk119_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_26>Do you think she'll be okay?</ScenarioTalk119_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_27>Yes, she'll be fine.&#10;I'll take care of her. I better bring an energy drink first.</ScenarioTalk119_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk119_1_28>-Berutaon laid her on the bed and went outside.-</ScenarioTalk119_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_1>-After he left, Florence spoke…-</ScenarioTalk120_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_2>I've got a favor to ask you.</ScenarioTalk120_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_3>What is it?</ScenarioTalk120_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_4>I heard that the Black Robes have more than one lab in Berna.</ScenarioTalk120_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_5> We're looking all over for it, but we're short on manpower.&#10;Can you help us find where they are?</ScenarioTalk120_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_6>Absolutely, we'll do our best.</ScenarioTalk120_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_7>But…&#10;You have to keep it secret from Regiana.</ScenarioTalk120_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_8>What?</ScenarioTalk120_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_9>They shouldn't know about this.&#10;No one we can't trust should know about this.</ScenarioTalk120_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_10>Hmm… Okay.-I feel uncomfortable keeping things from her…&#10;We have no choice, though.-</ScenarioTalk120_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk120_1_11>Then, you take care of Grrr Plain.&#10;Let me know if you find anything.</ScenarioTalk120_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_1>After searching harsh environment for days,&#10;we didn't find anything in Grrr Plain…</ScenarioTalk120_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_2>Well, you can't always succeed.&#10;Let's go and talk to Florence.</ScenarioTalk120_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_3>Hey, you're back.&#10;I've got bad news! Regiana betrayed us!</ScenarioTalk120_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_4>What do you mean?&#10;Regiana betrayed us?</ScenarioTalk120_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_5>That's right.&#10;I followed her when I saw her go outside last night. She was with the Black Robes.</ScenarioTalk120_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_6>Maybe she was kidnapped.</ScenarioTalk120_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_7>That's not it. She followed them on her own.&#10;So I was able to follow them to their lab without being noticed and found out where it was.</ScenarioTalk120_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_8>I knew it! She was a spy!</ScenarioTalk120_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_9>-I was pretty shaken by the fact that she's a spy.&#10;I couldn't believe that she was deceiving us all this time.-</ScenarioTalk120_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_10>We're preparing to attack their lab.&#10;Aidra has come to Berna.</ScenarioTalk120_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_11> Would you like to join us? The Dwarves will be with us, too.</ScenarioTalk120_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_12>Yes! Certainly!&#10;I wanna see for myself if she really betrayed us.</ScenarioTalk120_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk120_2_13>-I have to find out the truth about Regiana.&#10;If she really betrayed us, I have no choice, but…-</ScenarioTalk120_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_1>-Last night, outside the Elves' base-</ScenarioTalk121_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_2>Ha…</ScenarioTalk121_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_3>After I learned about the seal of Rajhid,&#10;I've been feeling so restless.</ScenarioTalk121_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_4>Poor… Regiana…</ScenarioTalk121_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_5>No…</ScenarioTalk121_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_6>Heh heh… I've been waiting for you to be alone.&#10;Let's go back.</ScenarioTalk121_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_7>No, you're gonna kill me, too!&#10;You're gonna use for your experiment!</ScenarioTalk121_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_8>Regiana, you're very special.&#10;Nothing like that will happen to you.&#10;I promise.</ScenarioTalk121_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_9>That's a lie!</ScenarioTalk121_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_10>Hmm, we took care of you since you were abandoned by your mother.&#10;It was us who took you in and raised you!</ScenarioTalk121_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_11>That… that…</ScenarioTalk121_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_12>After everything we've done for you, you won't listen to us!&#10;Do you think your new friends will be safe if you don't come back?&#10;I can cover this place with Poison Spores!</ScenarioTalk121_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_13>No!&#10;Don't do that!</ScenarioTalk121_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk121_1_14>Oh, so now you listen.&#10;Then, follow me. Heh heh…</ScenarioTalk121_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_1>-Black Robes' Lab in Highland Baha-</ScenarioTalk121_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_2>Hey, no one's here.&#10;I think they left!</ScenarioTalk121_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_3>Did they know we're coming?</ScenarioTalk121_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_4>I don’t think so.&#10;Since there are no signs of experimentation, they were about to leave, anyway.</ScenarioTalk121_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_5>Here are some documents… Hmm…</ScenarioTalk121_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_6>Anything important?</ScenarioTalk121_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_7>It's about waking the Avatar of Rajhid.&#10;The map was right.&#10;Only…</ScenarioTalk121_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_8>Only???</ScenarioTalk121_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_9>It says how to get the blood of Berna.&#10;That is… synthesize a dragon and human?&#10;It also mentions the descendant of Berna… Perhaps…?</ScenarioTalk121_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_10>What? What does it say?&#10;Tell us!</ScenarioTalk121_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_11>Here, they were studying how to synthesize dragons and humans.&#10;As a result, they created Regiana…</ScenarioTalk121_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_12>What do you mean?&#10;Regiana is what?</ScenarioTalk121_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_13>Regiana is the outcome of their experiment.&#10;They turned a dragon known into a human form, and that's Regiana.</ScenarioTalk121_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_14>!?!?</ScenarioTalk121_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_15>Then, the Black Robes learned about the daughter of Berna.&#10;After some testing, they happened to find out it was Regiana…</ScenarioTalk121_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_16>If she's the daughter of Berna, they're gonna use Regiana's blood to wake the Avatar of Rajhid! </ScenarioTalk121_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk121_2_17>I think they went to wake the Avatar of Rajhid!</ScenarioTalk121_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_1>Finally, the moment we all have been waiting for…&#10;This is great, my followers!</ScenarioTalk122_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_2>The Avatar of Death has come!&#10;Master, we need more time.&#10;You must first fully recover your power.</ScenarioTalk122_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_3>The darkness won't forget your devotion.&#10;I've been waiting for this moment for so long.&#10;.A little bit more time won't make any difference…</ScenarioTalk122_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_4>You… you…</ScenarioTalk122_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_5>So it's yours.&#10;That pure, beautiful blood that woke my soul trapped under cold aqua…</ScenarioTalk122_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_6>So it's you that unleashed me, the daughter of Berna, the one who locked me in the abyss in the first place!&#10;What irony! Ha ha!</ScenarioTalk122_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_7>What?&#10;You know my mother?</ScenarioTalk122_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_8>Of course, I do!&#10;How can I forget her? She sacrificed herself to save her daughter.</ScenarioTalk122_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_9>Sacrificed herself to save me…?&#10;Then, she didn't abandon me?</ScenarioTalk122_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_10>You didn't know?&#10;So, they didn't tell you?</ScenarioTalk122_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_11>They lied to me!&#10;They said she'd abandoned me!</ScenarioTalk122_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_12>That's basically the same thing.&#10;She let you wander around like a wounded animal…</ScenarioTalk122_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_13>So this was your plan from the very beginning?</ScenarioTalk122_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_14>No. We didn't know it at first.&#10;When we found you, we were gonna have you do some chores and use you for our experiments.</ScenarioTalk122_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_15>Then, we tested your blood and found out that&#10;you're the daughter of Bright Dragon Berna!</ScenarioTalk122_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk122_1_16>What? Was I a dragon?</ScenarioTalk122_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_1>No time to lose!&#10;Send our soldiers to get rid of her!</ScenarioTalk123_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_2>She's the seed of evil.&#10;Her existence is against the law of God!</ScenarioTalk123_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_3>You can't call an innocent girl the seed of evil… I don't agree with you!&#10;She was used by the Black Robes. She's a victim!</ScenarioTalk123_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_4>What about Dark Frosty?&#10;They attacked you. Was it their own fault?</ScenarioTalk123_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_5>Well… that's…</ScenarioTalk123_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_6>Think about it.&#10;Your judgment is affected by her appearance as a human.</ScenarioTalk123_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_7>-Srorin was right. When we were fighting the Dark Frosty, I didn't hesitate.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_8>-But when it comes to Regiana, I can't make up my mind.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_9>-I just don't want anyone to be used this way…-</ScenarioTalk123_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_10>How about you?&#10;What do you think is the right thing to do?</ScenarioTalk123_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_11>-As Aidra asked that question, everyone was looking at me.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_12>-They're all waiting for my answer.&#10;It felt like there's something stuck in my chest and my head started to ache like when I got hit by Poison Spore.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_13>-The last few days I spent with her flashed before my eyes.&#10;But at the moment, the image of Regiana overlapped with Dark Frosty.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_14>-The image of the Dark Frosty lying on the ground came to my mind.&#10;They were used and abandoned by the Black Robes.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_15>-That should never happen again!&#10;We can't give up saving lives because it's dangerous!-</ScenarioTalk123_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_16>I'm gonna save Regiana.&#10;We gave up on Dark Frosty, but I won't make the same mistake again.</ScenarioTalk123_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_17>Do you think it's possible?&#10;Even if you manage to save her this time, the Black Robes will keep coming after her.</ScenarioTalk123_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_18>That's right!&#10;Death may be her only chance to be free!</ScenarioTalk123_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_19>You… really…</ScenarioTalk123_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_20>If that's how you feel, I am on your side.</ScenarioTalk123_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_21>-Nuri seemed to be surprised by Zimon's response.&#10;After all, he's the one who always thought Regiana was a spy.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_22>My master said we should never lose hope.&#10;</ScenarioTalk123_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_23>If she was somehow forced to go with the Black Robes,&#10;I'm not gonna give up on her.</ScenarioTalk123_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_24>Yes! That's it!</ScenarioTalk123_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_25>-All of a sudden, the ground started to shake.-</ScenarioTalk123_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_26>What's this?&#10;Is it an earthquake?</ScenarioTalk123_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_27>No way?&#10;Has it started already?</ScenarioTalk123_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_28>No time to lose.&#10;We've gotta hurry!&#10;Gather our soldiers!</ScenarioTalk123_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk123_1_29>Tut, tut, still can't decide what to do?&#10;It's show time! Heh heh…</ScenarioTalk123_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_1>So I am a daughter of a dragon?</ScenarioTalk124_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_2>You don't even remember who your mother was?&#10;You poor thing!</ScenarioTalk124_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_3>Your mother was the most beautiful, kind-hearted, and powerful dragon.&#10;Even I respected her.</ScenarioTalk124_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_4>She did so much for me!&#10;She saved my life when I was abandoned by my own kind,&#10;and got me these beautiful wings…</ScenarioTalk124_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_5>And locked me under that cold lake…&#10;It was all her.</ScenarioTalk124_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_6>Now, I am unleashed thanks to her.&#10;Because of you, her only child. Heh heh…</ScenarioTalk124_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_7>That's a lie! I'm not the child of a dragon!&#10;I am a human!</ScenarioTalk124_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_8>Of course, you can't remember.&#10;You were just an egg before you became a human…</ScenarioTalk124_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_9>No! That's not possible!</ScenarioTalk124_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_10>I'd show it to you right now.&#10;But as you can see, I'm barely keeping my form myself…</ScenarioTalk124_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_11> I don't like it this way, but I have no choice.</ScenarioTalk124_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_12>My followers, bring me some offerings.&#10;I'll give you a chance to sacrifice yourself to the Avatar of Death!</ScenarioTalk124_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk124_1_13>Yes, Master…</ScenarioTalk124_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_1>-Thanks to the earthquake, we managed to get away from Florence and headed toward the Central Lake.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_1>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_2>-The dark clouds that swallowed the sun were spewing thunder and lightning,&#10;and there was a red waterspout on the lake.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_2>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_3>-After getting through the strong wind, we finally found Regiana.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_3>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_4>Regiana, where are you? Regiana!</ScenarioTalk124_2_4>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_5>Hey, I see someone over there!</ScenarioTalk124_2_5>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_6>-Nuri ran up to her and see if she was okay.&#10;She was mumbling something we couldn't understand. She didn't seem to be in her right mind.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_6>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_7>Regiana!&#10;Wake up!</ScenarioTalk124_2_7>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_8>What's that on the lake?&#10;That's…</ScenarioTalk124_2_8>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_9>-Zimon found something on the lake and pointed at it.&#10;I was shocked at the sight.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_9>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_10>-There were a lot of dragons floating on the lake.&#10;There were more than a few dozens of them.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_10>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_11>What are they? Are they all dead?</ScenarioTalk124_2_11>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_12>It looks that way…</ScenarioTalk124_2_12>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_13>Regiana!&#10;What's the matter? What happened to you?</ScenarioTalk124_2_13>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_14>You are strangers.</ScenarioTalk124_2_14>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_15>Who are you?</ScenarioTalk124_2_15>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_16>I’m Rajhid, one of the five Decons who serve the God of Darkness, Kades.</ScenarioTalk124_2_16>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_17>The Rajhid of Death was resurrected!&#10;So, what Berutaon said was true after all.</ScenarioTalk124_2_17>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_18>Oh, you know my full name…&#10;You honor me.</ScenarioTalk124_2_18>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_19>What did you do to her?</ScenarioTalk124_2_19>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_20>Absolutely nothing… Heh heh…&#10;She just can’t face the reality… Heh.</ScenarioTalk124_2_20>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_21>-The scary sound of his laughter eked out of his black mask.-</ScenarioTalk124_2_21>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_22>What about those dragons?&#10;Did you do it?</ScenarioTalk124_2_22>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_23>Oh, them?&#10;Don’t worry. I just sent them back to Latea without causing any pain.</ScenarioTalk124_2_23>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_24>That’s outrageous!&#10;I won’t let you get away with this!</ScenarioTalk124_2_24>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_25>I don't expect you to show me respect…&#10;But I still can't tolerate your attitude.</ScenarioTalk124_2_25>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_26>What did you say?&#10;Do you think you will be okay after killing so many dragons?</ScenarioTalk124_2_26>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_27>Darkness is more merciful than light.&#10;Their souls have become part of me now.&#10;It was such a blessing for them. Much better than them dying in some lab.</ScenarioTalk124_2_27>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_28>What a ridiculous thing to say!&#10;Rajhid, you’re nothing but a scoundrel who takes innocent lives!</ScenarioTalk124_2_28>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_29>Oh, your appearance, personality, and way of speaking are all intolerable.&#10;The existence of such pathetic creatures is the biggest tragedy in this world.</ScenarioTalk124_2_29>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_30>Now, I'll free the lives trapped inside your intolerable shell.&#10;Don’t be afraid. There’ll be no pain if you don’t resist.&#10;Darkness is more merciful than light.</ScenarioTalk124_2_30>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_31>How crazy!</ScenarioTalk124_2_31>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_32>We‘re not gonna let you do that.</ScenarioTalk124_2_32>
    <ScenarioTalk124_2_33>Followers, show those poor creatures the mercy of darkness!</ScenarioTalk124_2_33>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_1>Krr… They got us.</ScenarioTalk125_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_2>Tsk-tsk!&#10;You’re no match for us!</ScenarioTalk125_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_3>Master, we’re sorry…&#10;We’re trying to hold them off until you recover your power…</ScenarioTalk125_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_4>Master, what’s the matter?</ScenarioTalk125_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_5>-Rajhid held out his arms toward the followers.&#10;Then, dark lights shot from his hands like snakes and coiled around their necks.-</ScenarioTalk125_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_6>I acknowledge your loyalty.&#10;The darkness won’t forget your noble sacrifice!</ScenarioTalk125_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_7>No!Ahh!</ScenarioTalk125_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_8>-Caught up in the hand of their master, they all screamed in pain.&#10;They turned into hideous skeletons and fell on the ground one by one.-</ScenarioTalk125_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_9>He killed his own followers.</ScenarioTalk125_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_10>Well, they deserved what they got.&#10;It’s still a pity to see them die like that.</ScenarioTalk125_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_11>Sorry to keep you waiting so long.&#10;I spent too much time testing my power.</ScenarioTalk125_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_12>Testing?&#10;Your bluff won't work on us!</ScenarioTalk125_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_13>Well… He doesn’t seem to be bluffing…</ScenarioTalk125_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_14>Don’t worry. I won't waste too much energy on you.&#10;It’s time to do away with those ugly bodies of yours.</ScenarioTalk125_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_15>Ugly? Look who's talking!&#10;You look like a sick pigeon!</ScenarioTalk125_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_16>I keep telling you!&#10;He’s not bluffing!</ScenarioTalk125_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_17>Heh heh…&#10;Feel the true power of darkness! How beautiful it is!</ScenarioTalk125_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_18>-The decon with black wings mocked us with his words.&#10;The resurrected Rajhid was on a whole other level.&#10;With just one sweep of hand, our bodies felt like they were nailed to a wall. We couldn’t even move a finger.-</ScenarioTalk125_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_19>Hey…&#10;Run!</ScenarioTalk125_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_20>I… can’t move…</ScenarioTalk125_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_21>-Nuri and Zimon couldn’t move, either.&#10;So, this is the power of the Decon.&#10;How powerful would the other four be?-</ScenarioTalk125_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_22>Your souls are as light as dust and as trivial as bugs.&#10;Now it’s time to embrace your fate.</ScenarioTalk125_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_23>-Rajhid spread his wings, yelling arrogantly.&#10;So this is the fear of darkness, the power of the Decon.-</ScenarioTalk125_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_24>Now, die in despair and pain. You should hate your very own, insignificant existence!</ScenarioTalk125_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_25>No!</ScenarioTalk125_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_26>Re… Regiana!</ScenarioTalk125_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_27>-At the moment, Regiana ran and stood between Rajhid and me.&#10;There was a dagger from one of the Black Robes in her hand.&#10;It looked very heavy for her small, skinny hand.-</ScenarioTalk125_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_28>No… more!&#10;Keep away from them!</ScenarioTalk125_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_29>Ho? So melodramatic!&#10;Just like her mother.</ScenarioTalk125_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_30>This reminds me of old times.&#10;Your mother, Berna, also acted like you.</ScenarioTalk125_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_31>The result was…&#10;She was killed by the one she saved…&#10;And she let her daughter live a miserable life. Heh heh…</ScenarioTalk125_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_32>No… That’s not true!&#10;I realized after I met them.</ScenarioTalk125_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_33>I can help others…&#10;I’ve got a purpose in life…&#10;And…</ScenarioTalk125_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_34>I can be loved by someone…</ScenarioTalk125_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_35>-Regiana turned around and smiled at me.&#10;At that moment, I realized that&#10;she was going to risk her life to save us…-</ScenarioTalk125_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_36>No, Regiana…</ScenarioTalk125_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_37>Thank you.&#10;Even it was just for a short time…</ScenarioTalk125_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_38>Stop!Don’t do it!</ScenarioTalk125_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_39>Heeyah!</ScenarioTalk125_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk125_1_40>Regiana!</ScenarioTalk125_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_1>Where am I?</ScenarioTalk126_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_2>Am I dead?</ScenarioTalk126_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_3>Regiana…</ScenarioTalk126_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_4>Who is it?&#10;Someone's calling me.</ScenarioTalk126_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_5>It seems my daughter forgot her mother’s voice.</ScenarioTalk126_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_6>M-Mom?&#10;</ScenarioTalk126_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_7>That’s right. It’s your mother.&#10;I’m sorry that I left you alone in this world.</ScenarioTalk126_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_8>No, mom.&#10;Now I know you didn’t abandon me.&#10;You’ve protected me all this time.</ScenarioTalk126_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_9>Right, dear. I’m proud of you. You've grown so well.</ScenarioTalk126_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_10>Mom, you’ll stay with me from now on, won’t you?</ScenarioTalk126_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_11>Regiana, my dear daughter.&#10;Look at yourself.&#10;You’re much stronger than you think.</ScenarioTalk126_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_12>Stronger?</ScenarioTalk126_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_13>Go and save your friends.&#10;Just like I love you…</ScenarioTalk126_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_14>Mom, please don’t go! Mom!</ScenarioTalk126_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_15>That’s the light we saw before.&#10;Regiana?</ScenarioTalk126_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_16>-As Regiana ran toward Rajhid, a bright, warm light gathered around her, like it was embracing her.&#10;Then, a pair of bright wings grew on her back.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_17>That's… Those are!&#10;The wings of a dragon?</ScenarioTalk126_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_18>Zimon, this is a dream, right?&#10;Am I dreaming?</ScenarioTalk126_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_19>That’s what I wanna ask you…&#10;Hey, what’s that?</ScenarioTalk126_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_20>-The light that surrounding her scattered and rushed upon us.&#10;We all felt the warm energy and recovered strength.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_21>This feels amazing!&#10;My wounds are being healed!</ScenarioTalk126_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_22>You’re right! I can’t believe it…&#10;Hey, guys! Look over there!</ScenarioTalk126_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_23>How’s your wound?</ScenarioTalk126_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_24>That’s her voice… Regiana?&#10;Is that you, Regiana?</ScenarioTalk126_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_25>Yes, it’s me.</ScenarioTalk126_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_26>A human transformed into a dragon…&#10;I couldn’t believe what’s happening in front of me.</ScenarioTalk126_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_27>I didn’t know… I mean I forgot.&#10;Who I was and who my mother, Berna, was…&#10;But now I remember.</ScenarioTalk126_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_28>Berna?&#10;So your mother is the mythical dragon, Berna?</ScenarioTalk126_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_29>Yes.&#10;I’m a daughter of the Bright Dragon, Berna!&#10;And…</ScenarioTalk126_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_30>-She looked at me in the eyes.&#10;With eyes so bright and pure, I was certain that it’s her.&#10;Regiana turned around and yelled at Rajhid.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_31>Now, in the name of my mother, Berna, I will protect my friends!</ScenarioTalk126_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_32>-Warm light shot out of her body.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_33>Krrr… Arrrrgh!&#10;Defeated by mere bugs…</ScenarioTalk126_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_34>You’re done.&#10;Give up now!</ScenarioTalk126_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_35>Yes. Now, it’s time you get your revenge.&#10;Tear off these wings.&#10;This body is just a shell, anyway…</ScenarioTalk126_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_36>What, just a shell?</ScenarioTalk126_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_37>He’s bluffing.&#10;Regiana, finish him!</ScenarioTalk126_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_38>Yeah, Regiana!&#10;Don’t listen to him!</ScenarioTalk126_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_39>-Regiana looked me, then Rajhid.&#10;She was hesitating.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_40>Look what you’ve done to me… Now you feel guilty?&#10;Or you feel sorry for the shell you are wearing? Heh heh…</ScenarioTalk126_1_40>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_41>That… That’s…</ScenarioTalk126_1_41>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_42>Your shell is no different from mine.&#10;Of course, it wasn’t your fault. Don’t feel guilty…</ScenarioTalk126_1_42>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_43>Oops… While we were talking nonsense…&#10;Your chance to get your revenge has gone!</ScenarioTalk126_1_43>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_44>-Rajhid spread his arms, spreading green smoke.&#10;Like snakes, the trails of smoke coiled in the air&#10;and blew up into a green cloud.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_44>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_45>Hey, Poison Spores!&#10;Everybody, look out!</ScenarioTalk126_1_45>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_46>Poison Spores?&#10;Ahh!</ScenarioTalk126_1_46>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_47>Hey, wait up for me!</ScenarioTalk126_1_47>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_48>Krrr… Mwa ha ha!</ScenarioTalk126_1_48>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_49>-With her warning, we all ran as fast as we could.&#10;Rajhid stood there, convulsing with evil laughter.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_49>
    <ScenarioTalk126_1_50>-The huge cloud of Poison Spores swallowed Rajhid.&#10;We ran for a long time. Then, there was a big explosion and the laughter stopped.-</ScenarioTalk126_1_50>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_1>-After the explosion subsided and Rajhid was gone, the lake became peaceful again.&#10;The melodic sound of birds and splashing water tickled our ears.&#10;Looking at the calm lake, I felt like the last few days were just a nightmare.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_2>Here you are!</ScenarioTalk127_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_3>Florence?&#10;What’s up?</ScenarioTalk127_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_4>What do you mean?&#10;Did you forget that Aidra invited you to the party?</ScenarioTalk127_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_5>Of… course not.&#10;We’ll be there for sure!</ScenarioTalk127_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_6>-To be honest, I didn’t recall her invitation, but I could tell from her expression.&#10;Florence had that cold expression on her face whenever she was telling the truth.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_7>Okay, then.&#10;Now let’s go.&#10;I’ll guide you.</ScenarioTalk127_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_8>-When we arrived at the party, it was already full of excitement.&#10;Although the Elves and Dwarves were sitting at separate tables, they’re enjoying themselves.</ScenarioTalk127_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_9>-Srorin saw me and came up to us.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_10>Oh, our hero is finally here!&#10;Now, there's plenty of food and drinks. Enjoy the party!</ScenarioTalk127_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_11>-He held out a big, smoked pig leg to me.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_12>No… thank you.&#10;I’m not that hungry…</ScenarioTalk127_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_13>Hey, warrior!&#10;What’re you talking about?</ScenarioTalk127_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_14>Look at all this amazing food on the table.&#10;This is for you. You have to finish them off, just like you finish off your enemies!&#10;Ha ha!</ScenarioTalk127_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_15>-Hearing his boisterous words, everyone started laughing out loud.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_16>The stars are shining ever so bright!&#10;Welcome to the party, warrior!</ScenarioTalk127_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_17>-Aidra came to greet us, smiling.&#10;Having seen her cold expression, it felt strange to see her smile.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_18>By the way, where is Regiana?</ScenarioTalk127_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_19>Regiana is… I mean…</ScenarioTalk127_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_20>I’m here.</ScenarioTalk127_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_21>-I turned around to see her at the entrance.&#10;She poked her head out from the door.&#10;Everyone was looking at her.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_22>Please don’t mind me!</ScenarioTalk127_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_23>Oh, you can’t come in. Of course…&#10;I’m sorry. It’s my mistake.</ScenarioTalk127_1_23>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_24>-The queen of Elves bowed her head slightly.&#10;She looked away, nervous that all the eyes were on her.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_24>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_25>I’m glad you’re okay, but I can’t stop thinking about you.&#10;So I’m gonna make a suggestion.</ScenarioTalk127_1_25>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_26>Why don’t you go to Elysium with us?</ScenarioTalk127_1_26>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_27>Take her to Elysium?&#10;Isn’t it great?</ScenarioTalk127_1_27>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_28>Well, it is.&#10;But you said it didn’t matter if she died or not…</ScenarioTalk127_1_28>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_29>The Black Robes may come after you again.&#10;We want to protect you from them!</ScenarioTalk127_1_29>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_30>-With her bold suggestion, everyone in the party started whispering.&#10;Satisfied with the people’s reaction, she smiled.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_30>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_31>Thank you.&#10;But I’m not going to Elysium.</ScenarioTalk127_1_31>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_32>Because… I already decided where I want to be.</ScenarioTalk127_1_32>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_33>-She paused and looked at me.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_33>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_34>When I didn’t know I was a dragon,&#10;I thought that Dragon Tamers were simply&#10;those who train dragons.</ScenarioTalk127_1_34>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_35>But now I know.&#10;Their relationship is more than just friendship.&#10;They are bonded by something deeper.</ScenarioTalk127_1_35>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_36>I decided to be with the tamer who made me realize this.&#10;That’s him!</ScenarioTalk127_1_36>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_37>-Everyone at the party applauded at what she said.&#10;What should I do? Should I wave my hand or express my appreciation…?-</ScenarioTalk127_1_37>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_38>-Aidra seemed to be surprised by what she said.&#10;But she smiled and answered her.-</ScenarioTalk127_1_38>
    <ScenarioTalk127_1_39>I see, Dragon.&#10;But be careful. The Black Robes are everywhere.</ScenarioTalk127_1_39>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_1>-As the party was coming to an end,&#10;there was a big fuss in the corner.-</ScenarioTalk128_1_1>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_2>How dare you…?&#10;Don't get in my way!</ScenarioTalk128_1_2>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_3>Who’s blocking you!?&#10;It’s you who’s in my way!</ScenarioTalk128_1_3>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_4>What?&#10;You small, rude, smelly dwarf! Get the hell out of my sight!</ScenarioTalk128_1_4>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_5>Lousy pointy ears!&#10;You must be a mistake by the Creator.&#10;Your sorry existence couldn’t be his intention…</ScenarioTalk128_1_5>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_6>What? Pointy ears!?&#10;Do you wanna die here?</ScenarioTalk128_1_6>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_7>Stop!!!&#10;Mind your manners, Borutus.</ScenarioTalk128_1_7>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_8>I’m sorry… your highness.</ScenarioTalk128_1_8>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_9>Hmm, so there’s someone who knows how to behave after all.</ScenarioTalk128_1_9>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_10>You too, Angelo.&#10;There’ll be plenty of chances to settle your feud.</ScenarioTalk128_1_10>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_11>Hmm… I sense some animosity in your words, the Dwarf King.</ScenarioTalk128_1_11>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_12>Mwa ha ha, was it?&#10;Let’s just enjoy the rest of the party!</ScenarioTalk128_1_12>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_13>-Even with the peace treaty, there’s still hostility between them.&#10;Will there ever be peace between the Elves and Dwarves?-</ScenarioTalk128_1_13>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_14>-Shelter of Black Robes-</ScenarioTalk128_1_14>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_15>My master, the black wings went silent again.</ScenarioTalk128_1_15>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_16>So, everything turned out as you said.&#10;Good job…</ScenarioTalk128_1_16>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_17>You flatter me.&#10;All this happened, thanks to your great foresight.</ScenarioTalk128_1_17>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_18>You don’t have to hide them.&#10;The reason I keep you close to me is those deadly claws…</ScenarioTalk128_1_18>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_19>I don’t know what you mean by that…</ScenarioTalk128_1_19>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_20>Well, wait for my order, Eden.</ScenarioTalk128_1_20>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_21>-…-</ScenarioTalk128_1_21>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_22>Heh heh… You can count on me.</ScenarioTalk128_1_22>
    <ScenarioTalk128_1_23>I cannot wait till these claws are covered in blood.</ScenarioTalk128_1_23>


<!-- 안젤로의 정의 시나리오 -->
<ScenarioTalk129_1_1>Do you... do you think you'll be allright?</ScenarioTalk129_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_2>If I wasn't prepared, I didn't start. Since you lead us, only the downfall will be waiting for us anyway.</ScenarioTalk129_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_3>If we work with other species, we can all thrive together. Why don't you understand?</ScenarioTalk129_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_4>That is my word, why don't you understand? We have long been owners of this land, and they are strangers. How is it that we share ours with them and make it our prosperity?</ScenarioTalk129_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_5>So the way you came up with it is to work with the black lobe? You will be exploited and thrown away by them.</ScenarioTalk129_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_6>It doesn't matter. Under weak leader like you, the elves will be fall behind anyway. We elves need a strong leader like me!</ScenarioTalk129_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_7>And your death will make the elves follow me.</ScenarioTalk129_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_8>(grit her teeth)</ScenarioTalk129_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_9>So, I want you to take care of her. I have something to do.</ScenarioTalk129_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_10>All right, Aidra, the elf queen!  Let's finish this</ScenarioTalk129_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_11>(groan)</ScenarioTalk129_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_12>Die!!</ScenarioTalk129_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_13>(If only I'm in good condition...)</ScenarioTalk129_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_14>(After a little while, Aidra was eventually driven into a corner.)</ScenarioTalk129_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_15>(Is this the end? No! If I don't stop Angelo now, the worst will happen.)</ScenarioTalk129_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_16>If it were the last time...</ScenarioTalk129_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_17>Spirits of woods! Use the light of my life to destroy the evil!</ScenarioTalk129_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_18>What? How she could?!</ScenarioTalk129_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_19>Yipe!!</ScenarioTalk129_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_20>(huff)Now it's over.</ScenarioTalk129_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_21>Now... I hope.. someone finds....</ScenarioTalk129_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk129_1_22>(collapse)</ScenarioTalk129_1_22>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_1>As usual, peaceful Elpis.</ScenarioTalk130_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_2>Several months have already passed since the end of the fight with Rajhid.</ScenarioTalk130_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_3>Meanwhile, Elf and Dwarf began collecting force stone from Berna, and the threat of monsters almost disappeared from the Metal Tower and the Elysium.</ScenarioTalk130_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_4>By the way, I was supposed to meet Nuri here, but she doesn't show up until the appointed time has passed. Did something happen?</ScenarioTalk130_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_5>Sh, quiet! Follow me!</ScenarioTalk130_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_6>I can hear the voice of Nuri. She walking behind the alley in awkward pose. </ScenarioTalk130_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_7>What happened?</ScenarioTalk130_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_8>Come here first! There are so many ears!</ScenarioTalk130_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_9>With that being said, I decided to follow.</ScenarioTalk130_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_10>Great! It's finally a quiet place to talk!</ScenarioTalk130_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_11>Watching the elated Nuri, Zimon is shaking his head.</ScenarioTalk130_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_12>Do we really need to do this? I think you read too many books about secret agents...</ScenarioTalk130_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_13>Well, this looks great, doesn't it?</ScenarioTalk130_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_14>Well ... come on, tell me what you want. I'm in a hurry.</ScenarioTalk130_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_15>Okay! Actually, I got a call from Florence. He need our help in a hurry, so please come to Elysium with you right now.</ScenarioTalk130_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_16>Florence?</ScenarioTalk130_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_17>Yes. He asked me to come quickly and quietly because it's very important and needs to be done in secret.</ScenarioTalk130_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_18>(If Florence had said so, it was really important!)</ScenarioTalk130_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk130_1_19>Then let's go right away! I got ta go see Florence!</ScenarioTalk130_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_1>- In front of Elysium gate castle</ScenarioTalk131_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_2>Hello, I want to see Florence.</ScenarioTalk131_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_3>Uh? Strager is not suppose to enter to castle.</ScenarioTalk131_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_4>What? But Florence called us!</ScenarioTalk131_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_5>No, not now. Come see him later!</ScenarioTalk131_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_6>No! He told me he had an urgent matter, ah... why?</ScenarioTalk131_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_7>I stopped Nuri from saying anything. The atmosphere in the castle is strange ...It's not the usual atmosphere of peace, but rather the atmosphere of chaos.</ScenarioTalk131_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_8>For now, we had better get away. I think we should find out what's going on first.</ScenarioTalk131_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_9>Right. Something we don't know seems to have happened now. we've got to figure it out!</ScenarioTalk131_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_10>So...? I got it.</ScenarioTalk131_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_11>We walked down the slope from the gate.</ScenarioTalk131_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_12>Huh? Can you hear anything?</ScenarioTalk131_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_13>Wait!</ScenarioTalk131_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_14>huff... you haven't gone far yet. Thank God.</ScenarioTalk131_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_15>Berutaon?</ScenarioTalk131_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_16>Yes, Florence left a message for you to come to the world tree. If I had missed you, I would have been very difficult to see Florence.</ScenarioTalk131_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_17>What's happening at Elysium?</ScenarioTalk131_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_18>What happend is more important that what's going on. Please let Florence tell the details.</ScenarioTalk131_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_19>I'd love to be with you, but I can't leave here now. Then, I hope the spirit bless your journey.</ScenarioTalk131_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_20>- Berutaon walked back into the castle with quick steps as if something were urgent. -</ScenarioTalk131_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk131_1_21>Okay. Shall we go to world tree?</ScenarioTalk131_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_1>You're here. Thank you for coming so quickly.</ScenarioTalk131_2_1>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_2>The hero of justice runs wherever somebody need help!</ScenarioTalk131_2_2>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_3>First of all, did you hear what happened?</ScenarioTalk131_2_3>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_4>No. Everybody doesn't say what's going on. What happened?</ScenarioTalk131_2_4>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_5>The story we're talking about should never be made public. Okay?</ScenarioTalk131_2_5>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_6>By the serious atmosphere of Florence, Even Nuri couldn't play a joke.</ScenarioTalk131_2_6>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_7>Not long ago, Aidra took a delegation to Metal Tower.</ScenarioTalk131_2_7>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_8>The talks were held in secret to the mood of reconciliation. The main agenda was to stop a minor armed clash in Berna.</ScenarioTalk131_2_8>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_9>But after the talks, Aidra went missing.</ScenarioTalk131_2_9>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_10>!!!</ScenarioTalk131_2_10>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_11>The Queen is missing?</ScenarioTalk131_2_11>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_12>Yes, the Queen is missing and recently, the elf is being led by Angelo.</ScenarioTalk131_2_12>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_13>What? That sucks!</ScenarioTalk131_2_13>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_14>Although Angelo is exclusive to the other species, he's been assisting the Queen for a long time and has been respected within the elves.</ScenarioTalk131_2_14>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_15>Angelo thinks the dwarf behind this, but I don't think so.</ScenarioTalk131_2_15>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_16>Even though dwarves are stupid, dwarves I know are not stupid enough to do such a rash thing.</ScenarioTalk131_2_16>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_17>(I think he really didn't want to give a little praise.)</ScenarioTalk131_2_17>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_18>But if the fact that Queen was missing from Metal Tower is known to the public, the other elves think dwarves did it.</ScenarioTalk131_2_18>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_19>We need your help investigating Aidra's disappearance without informing others.</ScenarioTalk131_2_19>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_20>Of course I'll help you with that! As a hero of justice!</ScenarioTalk131_2_20>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_21>Thank you. It's a great help to have you join.</ScenarioTalk131_2_21>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_22>If it's true that dwarves did it ....They won't survive.</ScenarioTalk131_2_22>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_23>(gulp)</ScenarioTalk131_2_23>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_24>Florence's voice, speaking in a calm voice, has an amazingly cold anger.</ScenarioTalk131_2_24>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_25>First of all, we will start looking at Metal Tower. If the queen is really attacked by dwarves, you can see there's something suspicious there.</ScenarioTalk131_2_25>
<ScenarioTalk131_2_26>Great! Let's go to Metal Tower!</ScenarioTalk131_2_26>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_1>So, we arrived at Metal Tower. What should we do now?</ScenarioTalk132_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_2>Since I can not move freely in the tower, I will look at the surroundings. Go to the tower and monitor their atmosphere.</ScenarioTalk132_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_3>I don't like it, but you'd better get Arnold's help. He can be trusted.</ScenarioTalk132_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_4>(Florence, praising Arnold, makes a awkward face.)</ScenarioTalk132_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_5>Where can we meet Arnold?</ScenarioTalk132_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_6>Must be at the gate of Colossus. He doesn't like to be stuck in the castle, so he always goes out.</ScenarioTalk132_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_7>Great! Then leave for the gate of Colossus!</ScenarioTalk132_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_8>- Elysium Square -</ScenarioTalk132_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_9>Angelo is giving a speech in front of a large audience within the hall.</ScenarioTalk132_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_10>Queen Aidra is missing.</ScenarioTalk132_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_11>Aidra has been leading us for a long time, and has been able to live a peaceful life.</ScenarioTalk132_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_12>But her disappearance has opened our eyes to reality. The reality that we were falling behind in peace.</ScenarioTalk132_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_13>Right now, Aidra is missing, but all we can do is call a few vigilante and tamer to search. Moreover, avoid places with monsters!</ScenarioTalk132_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_14>We still have to risk our lives in Berna to gather force stone, and Kronak regularly appears at Elysium, which makes us suffer.</ScenarioTalk132_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_15>We need more power. It refers to tained, more troops. They will prevent us from meeting this tragedy again.</ScenarioTalk132_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_16>Wait!</ScenarioTalk132_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_17>Berutaon jump up to the platform.</ScenarioTalk132_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_18>Aren't we too hasty now? There's still a chance that queen will be back.</ScenarioTalk132_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_19>You are so soft and easygoing, Berutaon.</ScenarioTalk132_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_20>Such complacency will not help us when we are in a crisis!</ScenarioTalk132_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_21>If we take things easy even when there's a little crisis like this, we won't be able to do anything when there's a really big crisis.</ScenarioTalk132_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_22>For the sake of the elves, pacifists like you should be silent!</ScenarioTalk132_1_22>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_23>Angelo! Angelo! Angelo!</ScenarioTalk132_1_23>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_24>Berutaon tried to say something more, but now he stepped down from the stage as if he realized that nothing was working.</ScenarioTalk132_1_24>
<ScenarioTalk132_1_25>For our future!</ScenarioTalk132_1_25>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_1>Well, my brothers! What are you doing here?</ScenarioTalk132_2_1>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_2>I knew you'd be here. I want to ask you something.</ScenarioTalk132_2_2>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_3>You came to see me! Ha ha ha! Ask me something!</ScenarioTalk132_2_3>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_4>We're investigating queen Aidra.</ScenarioTalk132_2_4>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_5>You mean Queen Elf? I came to metal tower because of the talks. It was a bother, but I was the only one close to the Elf, so I took the guide.</ScenarioTalk132_2_5>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_6>What? Then, where is Aidra?</ScenarioTalk132_2_6>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_7>Shouldn't you look for an elf at Elysium? I took her to the ship for Elysium.</ScenarioTalk132_2_7>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_8>Pardon? Did she go by ship?</ScenarioTalk132_2_8>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_9>Okay. I've been preparing for this meeting for quite some time. Everything went as planned.</ScenarioTalk132_2_9>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_10>Srorin gave her a big hand and talk about the future of Dwarf and Elf.</ScenarioTalk132_2_10>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_11>As the clash continues in Berna, Srorin and Aidra met in person to break this chain of anger. Now peace will finally come.</ScenarioTalk132_2_11>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_12>Well, actually....</ScenarioTalk132_2_12>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_13>We told Arnold the story of the disappearance.</ScenarioTalk132_2_13>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_14>What! No, that's ridiculous!!</ScenarioTalk132_2_14>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_15>I saw her leave by boat.</ScenarioTalk132_2_15>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_16>It's still known as a missing, but if she is found missing from Metal tower, the anger of the elves will be terrible.</ScenarioTalk132_2_16>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_17>No, then this is not the time to be like this. We have to let this out!</ScenarioTalk132_2_17>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_18>Wait a moment.</ScenarioTalk132_2_18>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_19>What are you doing here?</ScenarioTalk132_2_19>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_20>He came to Metal tower with us. He is in charge of this.</ScenarioTalk132_2_20>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_21>When looking around the neighborhood, I don't think dwarves are the culprit, but I think we'd better look at the atmosphere of castle.</ScenarioTalk132_2_21>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_22>What? You don't trust me?</ScenarioTalk132_2_22>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_23>I can believe you, but not all of dwarves are like you.In particular, Borutus's dislike of other species is already popular among elves.</ScenarioTalk132_2_23>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_24>Oh, of course Borutus is a bit like that, but... Usually, it's because of his loyalty to Srorin. Isn't Angelo serious in that respect?</ScenarioTalk132_2_24>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_25>That Angelo is now leading the elf. I thought he was going to blow his top for what he normally did, but he was calm.</ScenarioTalk132_2_25>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_26>He's still tough, but I think he does it for the elves.</ScenarioTalk132_2_26>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_27>Anyway, you'll have to go to castle with Arnold. Maybe Borutus did this without letting anyone know.</ScenarioTalk132_2_27>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_28>Well, yes. If Borutus did, I was against it. There is a matter of loyalty, a matter of loyalty.</ScenarioTalk132_2_28>
<ScenarioTalk132_2_29>Then let's go, brothers.</ScenarioTalk132_2_29>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_1>Oh, Arnold. What brought you to castle? you would have been out there again if it were normal. Nice to see you tamers, too.</ScenarioTalk133_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_2>I'm here in a hurry to let you know. Didn't Aidra come to see you a while ago?</ScenarioTalk133_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_3>Yes, finally, there is peace in Berna.</ScenarioTalk133_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_4>But after the meeting, Aidra went missing.</ScenarioTalk133_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_5>What? Is that true?</ScenarioTalk133_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_6>Yes, it's true. We came from Elysium to find Aidra.</ScenarioTalk133_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_7>And the elves suspect Borutus.</ScenarioTalk133_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_8>They doubt me? That's ridiculous.</ScenarioTalk133_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_9>You didn't do it, did you, Borutus?</ScenarioTalk133_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_10>Isn't that possible? It's not just because I hate elves. Because they hurt us, and we're having a hard time. If peace talks are signed, there's no reason I should hate them.</ScenarioTalk133_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_11>And even if I fight, attacking an enemy who came to negotiate is not my style! I'll play fair!</ScenarioTalk133_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_12>Yes, you will behave fairly. Come to think of it, none of us could attack the elves. Furthermore, Arnold took her safely to the ship.</ScenarioTalk133_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_13>That's right. It couldn't have happened inside Metal tower.</ScenarioTalk133_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_14>First, we'll try to find out if Aidra is in Metal tower. You find her at Elysium.</ScenarioTalk133_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_15>You may not believe me, but I really want to avoid this meaningless fight between dwarf and elf. </ScenarioTalk133_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_16>(When I saw the clear eyes of Srorin, I thought I could believe it.)</ScenarioTalk133_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk133_1_17>Okay. We'll go back to Elysium and look for Aidra.</ScenarioTalk133_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_1>Back to Elysium, we began to think about how to find the queen.</ScenarioTalk134_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_2>First of all, We're back to Elysium, but I feel tight because there's no clue.</ScenarioTalk134_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_3>If she was the queen I knew, she wouldn't have been kidnapped so easily. There must be some traces.</ScenarioTalk134_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_4>If dwarves confirmed she was on board and she was attacked by someone else, chances are she was attacked inside Elysium.</ScenarioTalk134_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_5>And since she wasn't visible to the public, it's a place where the elves don't go very well.</ScenarioTalk134_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_6>So maybe that's where the strong monsters come from, outside of Elysium.</ScenarioTalk134_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_7>Yes! Then let's search for the place!</ScenarioTalk134_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_8>- Elysium Castle -</ScenarioTalk134_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_9>Welcome everyone. You're the future of the elves.</ScenarioTalk134_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_10>There are young hard-line elves gathered around Angelo. They were very responsive to Angelo's speech earlier.</ScenarioTalk134_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_11>As Angelo said, elf needs to be stronger.</ScenarioTalk134_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_12>That's right. It is shame for us! I believe we are better than this.</ScenarioTalk134_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_13>I know everyone's mind, but don't rush it. We've been assuming peace for too long.</ScenarioTalk134_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_14>We can't win with troops of the vigilante level and with civilians who are just ahead of their minds. We must form a proper army.</ScenarioTalk134_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_15>Dwarf is not going to be our final goal. There is still a lot to be done for the ultimate goal of building a great nation of elves across all continents.</ScenarioTalk134_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_16>To do that, you have to help a lot as my guard.</ScenarioTalk134_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_17>Yes, I understand. Believe me.</ScenarioTalk134_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_18>At first, recruit people to volunteer for the army. Daiross will help their training.</ScenarioTalk134_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_19>When we get ready, we'll conquer Berna and monopolize force stone. Then dwarves will get tired of fighting with monsters.</ScenarioTalk134_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_20>That would be nice!</ScenarioTalk134_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk134_1_21>Move it! This is all for the elves!</ScenarioTalk134_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_1>I can see a dragon in the distance that feels something mysterious.</ScenarioTalk134_2_1>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_2>Oh, who is that dragon?</ScenarioTalk134_2_2>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_3>Oh, that's IIlan. He has been helping our elves for a long time.</ScenarioTalk134_2_3>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_4>Hello, Illan.</ScenarioTalk134_2_4>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_5>Oh, long time no see. Your name was... Florence. Yes, it was a very pretty name.</ScenarioTalk134_2_5>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_6>Thank you, Illan. We're looking for Aidra right now.</ScenarioTalk134_2_6>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_7>Aidra is here. She is badly injured and needs treatment.</ScenarioTalk134_2_7>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_8>Queen Aidra!</ScenarioTalk134_2_8>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_9>(As Illan moved, I could see her lying in the grass.)</ScenarioTalk134_2_9>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_10>When I found her, she had already been hurt a lot. Luckily, I found her first, so I could protect her from monsters.</ScenarioTalk134_2_10>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_11>Thank you very much, Illlan. Now I can protect the elves again.</ScenarioTalk134_2_11>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_12>Is there a big problem with the elves?</ScenarioTalk134_2_12>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_13>(Florence explained to Illan what had happened so far.)</ScenarioTalk134_2_13>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_14>It is sad...</ScenarioTalk134_2_14>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_15>But I can't help it. If the elf decides for themself, I respect the decision.</ScenarioTalk134_2_15>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_16>I see ...Okay. But as long as she wakes up, everything will be solved.</ScenarioTalk134_2_16>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_17>Okay. I'll see you later.</ScenarioTalk134_2_17>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_18>(Illan flew gracefully and disappeared from sight.)</ScenarioTalk134_2_18>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_19>Wow, I've never seen such an elegant dragon!</ScenarioTalk134_2_19>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_20>Yeah, a wild thing like you looks like you couldn't do for life.</ScenarioTalk134_2_20>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_21>What is it?! (Oops) Not at all, you know, I can do it.</ScenarioTalk134_2_21>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_22>(Zimon backed away with a look of disgust.))</ScenarioTalk134_2_22>
<ScenarioTalk134_2_23>Let's take her to Berutaon quickly. I'm sure Berutaon could cure her.</ScenarioTalk134_2_23>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_1>Angelo!</ScenarioTalk135_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_2>Um? Is it you again?</ScenarioTalk135_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_3>I heard the rumor that you are trying to organize troops.</ScenarioTalk135_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_4>Yes. Is there a problem?</ScenarioTalk135_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_5>Elf has tried to live in peace.</ScenarioTalk135_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_6>It could be a problem to be so aggressive right now.</ScenarioTalk135_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_7>You still live in the past!</ScenarioTalk135_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_8>Times have changed, wars are inevitable! How long do you think the current situation can be maintained by dividing Berna equally in half?</ScenarioTalk135_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_9>Even now Aidra is missing!</ScenarioTalk135_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_10>We have to protect ourselves. It is just an attractive imagination that the others choose peace just because we want it.</ScenarioTalk135_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_11>Do you understand if Berna is taken away, Elysium is burning, and all the elves live in pain?</ScenarioTalk135_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_12>But that assumption is too extreme!</ScenarioTalk135_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_13>When that happens, everything will be late! We must be ready before that happens.</ScenarioTalk135_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_14>This is my last question. Are you ready to stop that situation? or are you ready to do that?</ScenarioTalk135_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_15>If you have finished talking with ..., leave.</ScenarioTalk135_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_16>...</ScenarioTalk135_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_17>When Berutaon goes out, Angelo mumbles.</ScenarioTalk135_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_18>I'll call in the black robe and get rid of him.</ScenarioTalk135_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_19>- A few hours later, Berutaon Institute -</ScenarioTalk135_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_20>We finally got to the Barton lab! We have to treat Aidra soon ...</ScenarioTalk135_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_21>Ha ha ha ha. Welcome. What? He is not the elf we've been waiting for.</ScenarioTalk135_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_22>Black robe? Why are you here?</ScenarioTalk135_1_22>
<ScenarioTalk135_1_23>Well, you don't need to know! Wipe it all out!</ScenarioTalk135_1_23>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_1>Haha, Dragon Tamer is so strong.</ScenarioTalk135_2_1>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_2>Oh, long time no see... Are you black robe?</ScenarioTalk135_2_2>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_3>Come to this way, I'll complete my mission!</ScenarioTalk135_2_3>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_4>Forget it!</ScenarioTalk135_2_4>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_5>Nuri and even Zimon worked together to overcome the black robe</ScenarioTalk135_2_5>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_6>You guys, I'll get you for that!</ScenarioTalk135_2_6>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_7>Thank you. You helped me out of the menace of black robe.</ScenarioTalk135_2_7>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_8>As a hero of justice, it must be expected!</ScenarioTalk135_2_8>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_9>Why did the black robe attack me ......I don't understand.</ScenarioTalk135_2_9>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_10>Didn't you have a problem with someone today?</ScenarioTalk135_2_10>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_11>I don't usually make enemies, but I have often had a fight with Angelo recently. Cause Angelo's direction is very different from Aidra.</ScenarioTalk135_2_11>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_12>Don't tell me Angelo did it.</ScenarioTalk135_2_12>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_13>I'm not sure yet. I have something more urgent to do.</ScenarioTalk135_2_13>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_14>What?! Aidra!</ScenarioTalk135_2_14>
<ScenarioTalk135_2_15>If Angelo is a real secret, then Aidra is the only one who can stop him.</ScenarioTalk135_2_15>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_1>According to my checkup, Aidra is poisoned by powerful mana of Kades. Looks like someone secretly fed her.</ScenarioTalk136_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_2>Who the hell...</ScenarioTalk136_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_3>But if I have the ingredients, I can easily treat her. The problem is, I have a lot of herbs, but I need special herb that grows only in Kades' space.</ScenarioTalk136_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_4>I think you should get the herb.</ScenarioTalk136_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_5>Leave it to me! This is our specialty!</ScenarioTalk136_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_6>Then, please. If Aidra wakes up, everything will be solved.</ScenarioTalk136_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_7>I'll be back as soon as I can!</ScenarioTalk136_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_8>- Suburb of Elysium castle -</ScenarioTalk136_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_9>What are you calling for? I don't want to see your face.</ScenarioTalk136_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_10>I have a present for you.</ScenarioTalk136_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_11>Present?</ScenarioTalk136_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_12>Yes, it's called a seed.</ScenarioTalk136_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_13>There are necklaces made of stone in the box Eden took out.</ScenarioTalk136_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_14>You can inject a seed into live things and activate it.</ScenarioTalk136_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_15>When seeds are activated, they activate other seeds around them, strengthening everyone who had them.</ScenarioTalk136_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_16>And most important thing is, It greatly strengthens the injected target. More than you imagine.</ScenarioTalk136_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_17>Why do you give it to me?</ScenarioTalk136_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_18>Because... I think Aidra is still alive.</ScenarioTalk136_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_19>What did you say?</ScenarioTalk136_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_20>I went to check on the black robes I sent you because they were late to return, but I couldn't see Aidra and black robes were knocked down.</ScenarioTalk136_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_21>I give it to you in case she comes back. That will help you fight with Adara.</ScenarioTalk136_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_22>Although you're good at using sword, you won't be able to deal with all the elves when she gets back.</ScenarioTalk136_1_22>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_23>So go ahead and start the war before she comes back. I'm in trouble if you fail.</ScenarioTalk136_1_23>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_24>Is this the only way you can handle the most important things? Humans...</ScenarioTalk136_1_24>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_25>There are only incompetent people in the black robes. I apologize.</ScenarioTalk136_1_25>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_26>But if you start a war, there won't be much she can do even if Aidra gets back.</ScenarioTalk136_1_26>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_27>If the war has already started and each other is filled with hatred, then no one can stop.</ScenarioTalk136_1_27>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_28>I wish you success then.</ScenarioTalk136_1_28>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_29>Well, let's see.</ScenarioTalk136_1_29>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_30>Watching Angelo leave with the box, Eden mumbles.</ScenarioTalk136_1_30>
<ScenarioTalk136_1_31>Keep your chin up. That way, my plan will succeed.</ScenarioTalk136_1_31>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_1>I don't get used to Kades' space even after a few visits ...</ScenarioTalk136_2_1>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_2>Something squashy in the air... and I wanna find it and go back quickly</ScenarioTalk136_2_2>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_3>Nice! I found it!</ScenarioTalk136_2_3>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_4>Oh! It looks just like the picture that Berutaon painted.</ScenarioTalk136_2_4>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_5>Great! Let's go back to Elysium quickly!</ScenarioTalk136_2_5>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_6>- Elysium Castle -</ScenarioTalk136_2_6>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_7>Angelo's guard is centered around Angelo.</ScenarioTalk136_2_7>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_8>Everyone got together quickly. Take one of these first.</ScenarioTalk136_2_8>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_9>Angelo handed out the seeds one by one.</ScenarioTalk136_2_9>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_10>What is this?</ScenarioTalk136_2_10>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_11>Scalp only for those I trust. I really wanted to, but I saved it for the most important moment.</ScenarioTalk136_2_11>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_12>The elves moved at Angelo's words, looking at Angelo.</ScenarioTalk136_2_12>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_13>The reason I called you today is because of something related to Aidra</ScenarioTalk136_2_13>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_14>In fact, Aidra was attacked by the dwarves in Metal tower.</ScenarioTalk136_2_14>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_15>Yes? Is that true?</ScenarioTalk136_2_15>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_16>Okay. Aidra went to Metal tower for peace talks, but died after being attacked by mean dwarves.</ScenarioTalk136_2_16>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_17>The elves are full of anger.</ScenarioTalk136_2_17>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_18>The reason I haven't told this is because we didn't have enough power. Not enough now, but it should be enough to handle the dwarves.</ScenarioTalk136_2_18>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_19>Everyone is ready to sacrifice your lives for the elf, right?</ScenarioTalk136_2_19>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_20>Yep !! Yes.</ScenarioTalk136_2_20>
<ScenarioTalk136_2_21>Then, use all our troops to head for Berna. We will take her revenge.!</ScenarioTalk136_2_21>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_1>- Elysium Berutaon laboratory -</ScenarioTalk137_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_2>Eww ...</ScenarioTalk137_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_3>Aidra! Are you okay?</ScenarioTalk137_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_4>Oh, Florence! Where am I?</ScenarioTalk137_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_5>Berutaon laboratory. I'm glad you came to your senses.</ScenarioTalk137_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_6>Why would I... oh, how about Angelo? What happened to the elves?</ScenarioTalk137_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_7>Most elves just left for Berna for the war against dwarf. Angelo is leading them.</ScenarioTalk137_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_8>Oh, no... I don't think Angelo would go to this ......</ScenarioTalk137_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_9>We have to go to Berna right now and stop him!</ScenarioTalk137_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_10>I'll have to lend Aeuros his strength this time.</ScenarioTalk137_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_11>Okay. We'll head straight to Berna.</ScenarioTalk137_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_12>- Berna Island Elf side -</ScenarioTalk137_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_13>What?, how do the dwarves know and come before us?</ScenarioTalk137_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_14>There is no need to worry. This place will be their grave anyway.</ScenarioTalk137_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_15>Everyone, get ready for battle!</ScenarioTalk137_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_16>- The dwarf side -</ScenarioTalk137_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_17>Elves... I guess they are really going to fight.</ScenarioTalk137_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_18>It would be natural to believe that we were involved in the disappearance of Aidra.</ScenarioTalk137_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk137_1_19>We need to prepare for battle. We have to prepare for the worst!</ScenarioTalk137_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_1>- Berna Island -</ScenarioTalk138_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_2>Elves! The time has come to avenge our queen! For the Elf!</ScenarioTalk138_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_3>(shout)</ScenarioTalk138_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_4>Get ready to charge!</ScenarioTalk138_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_5>When all the elves were getting ready to charge.</ScenarioTalk138_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_6>Everyone stop!</ScenarioTalk138_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_7>Saila, who rode on the Aeuros, shouted in the sky.</ScenarioTalk138_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_8>She finally came.</ScenarioTalk138_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_9>Everyone stop! It wasn't the dwarf that attacked me.</ScenarioTalk138_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_10>It was Angelo! Angelo attacked me!</ScenarioTalk138_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_11>All the elves momentarily looked at Angelo.</ScenarioTalk138_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_12>You were lucky. I can't believe you got out of there.</ScenarioTalk138_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_13>No! What the hell is this?</ScenarioTalk138_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_14>If we go on like this, the elves will be ruined! The story of peace will be destroyed under your command!</ScenarioTalk138_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_15>Only I could stop the elf from downfall. Only me!</ScenarioTalk138_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_16>How can you talk such nonsense! You will be judged by the law!</ScenarioTalk138_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_17>Hahaha? law? You gonna stop me with such a trifle? Everything will be over here today!</ScenarioTalk138_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_18>Angelo momentarily took the seed and stuck it in his chest.</ScenarioTalk138_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_19>At the same time, a large wind blew around Angelo, and the elves around began to mutate.</ScenarioTalk138_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_20>Aaaaaah.......what is this !!!</ScenarioTalk138_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_21>No! Help me!</ScenarioTalk138_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_22>For the future of the Elf! Give your life!</ScenarioTalk138_1_22>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_23>Angelo! What the hell are you doing?</ScenarioTalk138_1_23>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_24>A threat is approaching. Aidra.</ScenarioTalk138_1_24>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_25>While you were only talking about peace, playing with dwarf, there was a lot going on outside.</ScenarioTalk138_1_25>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_26>It was hundreds of years ago that black robe appear, and legendary Kaciz and Kronak woke up.</ScenarioTalk138_1_26>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_27>Even the suspected god, Decon, the incarnation of the "Rajhid of Death", has appeared too. </ScenarioTalk138_1_27>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_28>Elves need power. The power to protect ourselves from these threats! If we had claimed to monopolize force stone in Berna and put dwarves to slavery, it would have been enough for us.</ScenarioTalk138_1_28>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_29>You are the worst leader ever to sell our future and buy the present!</ScenarioTalk138_1_29>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_30>Finally, Angelo's appearance changed dramatically.</ScenarioTalk138_1_30>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_31>I will carry my justice with all my might. Aidra.</ScenarioTalk138_1_31>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_32>That's terrible... We will get rid of the surrounding monsters. Please take care of Angelo.</ScenarioTalk138_1_32>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_33>Dwarf will join, too!</ScenarioTalk138_1_33>
<ScenarioTalk138_1_34>Thank you, Srorin! Then, take care that monster!</ScenarioTalk138_1_34>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_1>It's over, Angelo!</ScenarioTalk138_2_1>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_2>You are strong, such as him.</ScenarioTalk138_2_2>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_3>He?</ScenarioTalk138_2_3>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_4>Yes. He's the one who offered me. I'm sure he works with the black robe, but he's not black robe.</ScenarioTalk138_2_4>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_5>Come to think of it, I was used by him. Did he deliberately let Aidra live? Wasn't the elf and dwarf's war the goal?</ScenarioTalk138_2_5>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_6>I can't help it. I can't die here. I need to know the truth!</ScenarioTalk138_2_6>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_7>What?</ScenarioTalk138_2_7>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_8>When Angelo raised his hand, the surrounding monsters gathered around Angelo.</ScenarioTalk138_2_8>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_9>I don't like running away, but I'll see you later, boy.</ScenarioTalk138_2_9>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_10>Stop!!</ScenarioTalk138_2_10>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_11>I went ahead by killing monsters, but there were too many monsters around.</ScenarioTalk138_2_11>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_12>Monsters are too strong. I think we should send Angelo this time.</ScenarioTalk138_2_12>
<ScenarioTalk138_2_13>I've never seen such a powerful monster. It's more important to survive than to catch Angelo.</ScenarioTalk138_2_13>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_1>We missed Angelo, but it's over.</ScenarioTalk139_1_1>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_2>It looks like that. I'm glad it's over.</ScenarioTalk139_1_2>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_3>That's right. If you were any bit late and the war between dwarf and elf really happened, it wouldn't have ended this far.</ScenarioTalk139_1_3>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_4>Thank God. I didn't know Angelo would do anything so extreme.</ScenarioTalk139_1_4>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_5>We've got a problem.</ScenarioTalk139_1_5>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_6>(Daiross and Dogi are running in the distance.)</ScenarioTalk139_1_6>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_7>We've got a problem. Queen, the black lobes has attacked the Elysium castle.</ScenarioTalk139_1_7>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_8>The same goes for Metal towers. Black robes attacked the Metal tower's castle, too.</ScenarioTalk139_1_8>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_9>What?!</ScenarioTalk139_1_9>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_10>I'm sorry, but dragon tamer, who was leading the black robe, was too powerful. I think he was waiting for Srorin to leave before he attacked.</ScenarioTalk139_1_10>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_11>In Elysium, the another dragon tamer is so powerful...</ScenarioTalk139_1_11>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_12>How is the damage? What about the damage?</ScenarioTalk139_1_12>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_13>It happened so quickly that we couldn't even respond properly that not many people were injured. Only, he took something that was hidden inside the castle.</ScenarioTalk139_1_13>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_14>!! Talk about it!!</ScenarioTalk139_1_14>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_15>The object was like... darkness itself. It seemed I couldn't touch it. I've never seen anything like that</ScenarioTalk139_1_15>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_16>The same goes for Metal tower. In the beginning, as if we weren't our goal, they went deep through us and took something and disappeared.</ScenarioTalk139_1_16>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_17>Don't tell me ...</ScenarioTalk139_1_17>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_18>I think that's right.</ScenarioTalk139_1_18>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_19>What is it?</ScenarioTalk139_1_19>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_20>In the past, five wise men and others sealed Kades in pieces when they sealed him. And they divided them apart and hid them so someone wouldn't gather.</ScenarioTalk139_1_20>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_21>And then, elf and dwarf were keep it one by one.</ScenarioTalk139_1_21>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_22>Now, it is only a story that is passed down to the leaders, and I have only seen it one time since I was inaugurated.</ScenarioTalk139_1_22>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_23>But now, black lobe took it.</ScenarioTalk139_1_23>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_24>The goal of black robe from the start was not to start a war, but to steal the piece.</ScenarioTalk139_1_24>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_25>If they collect all the pieces of Kades, they might be able to revive them!</ScenarioTalk139_1_25>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_26>It would be a disaster for descendants of Amorru like us. Whatever happens, you must stop it!</ScenarioTalk139_1_26>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_27>Where are the other pieces?</ScenarioTalk139_1_27>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_28>We don't know the exact location either. It's been too long, and it's only for a few.</ScenarioTalk139_1_28>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_29>But I'm sure there's one in 'Baidel'. I heard the story that elf and dwarf helped Baidel when the darkness of the past tried to steal pieces of Kades.</ScenarioTalk139_1_29>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_30>Then I'll go straight to Baidel. We have to announce the threat of Black robe and stop them.</ScenarioTalk139_1_30>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_31>I need your help. Elf and dwarf should concentrate on domestic affairs for a while. You are the only hope.</ScenarioTalk139_1_31>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_32>Okay. You guys could do well.</ScenarioTalk139_1_32>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_33>(You guys?)</ScenarioTalk139_1_33>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_34>Of course! This is our specialty again!</ScenarioTalk139_1_34>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_35>(Nuri and Zimon are standing next to me. Then, I could see Zimon sighs at Nuri's attitude.</ScenarioTalk139_1_35>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_36>All right, let's go to Baidel!</ScenarioTalk139_1_36>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_37>- Black robe hidout -</ScenarioTalk139_1_37>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_38>You're a great man! In the last few decades, no one has ever collected two pieces ok Kades.</ScenarioTalk139_1_38>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_39>In this world where Amore has more power, the dark side was always the weak.</ScenarioTalk139_1_39>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_40>However, if we collect all the pieces of Kades and bring him back to life, we don't have to hide in the dark anymore!</ScenarioTalk139_1_40>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_41>Hahahahahah!</ScenarioTalk139_1_41>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_42>Others are just too useless. They are just elf and dwarf, and it's an easy prey for me.</ScenarioTalk139_1_42>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_43>Hahaha... OK. You said another piece is in Baidel?</ScenarioTalk139_1_43>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_44>Yes. Next target is a piece in Baidel. I'll bring it.</ScenarioTalk139_1_44>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_45>Hahaha. You're reliable. I believe in you.</ScenarioTalk139_1_45>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_46>The most useless is the most talked about. Well, it will be less painful at the end.</ScenarioTalk139_1_46>
<ScenarioTalk139_1_47>For now, I have to collect all the pieces... For now...</ScenarioTalk139_1_47>

    <EventTalk3_5>If you want to become strong, use the items wisely!</EventTalk3_5>
    <EventTalk3_6>We have to go! See you around!!</EventTalk3_6>
    <EventTalk3_7>See you later~!!!</EventTalk3_7>
    <EventTalk3_8>- Aha..... That's how you use the Level-down items... You should train a dragon just as strong as Raon's!! -</EventTalk3_8>
    <EventTalk3_9>- Better watch out, Raon!!!! -</EventTalk3_9>
    
    <EventTalk4_1>- You hear footsteps while exploring... -</EventTalk4_1>
    <EventTalk4_2>You again!! Haha. Is that your dragon?!</EventTalk4_2>
    <EventTalk4_3>I feel bad for your dragon... It is unfortunate that it got stuck with an incompetent Dragon Tamer~!</EventTalk4_3>
    <EventTalk4_4>What are you looking at?! Do you have a problem with me?!</EventTalk4_4>
    <EventTalk4_5>Ah! Let me teach you a lesson! I was looking for a sparring partner for my dragon.</EventTalk4_5>
    <EventTalk4_6>I will give you the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of fighting against my dragon! Come on!! Don't be a wimp!!</EventTalk4_6>
    <EventTalk4_7>- Grumpy Raon summoned his dragon. There is no way to escape... No! You decide not to run away from this fight!! -</EventTalk4_7>
    <EventTalk4_8>- His dragon is ridiculously strong..!! Raon won the fight... but he looked surprised -</EventTalk4_8>
    <EventTalk4_9>That was interesting! For a second, I thought I was gonna lose!</EventTalk4_9>
    <EventTalk4_10>But, you are still no match for me! Wipe that smile off your face!!!</EventTalk4_10>
    <EventTalk4_11>I won't forget this...!! We will meet again!!</EventTalk4_11>
    <EventTalk4_12>- Raon walked away... He is a very tough Dragon Tamer...&#10;I wonder how many strong Dragon Tamers like him are out there!! -</EventTalk4_12>
    <EventTalk4_13>- You need to train your dragon to be stronger than his!! -</EventTalk4_13>
    
    <EventTalk5_1>Huh...?! Are you here to explore? I am surprised that you've made it this far...!</EventTalk5_1>
    <EventTalk5_2>Or maybe you just got lucky!!</EventTalk5_2>
    <EventTalk5_3>- You glared at Raon -</EventTalk5_3>
    <EventTalk5_4>Oh~ I am so scared... Well, this is perfect... I was getting bored of this adventure anyway!!</EventTalk5_4>
    <EventTalk5_5>- ?! -</EventTalk5_5>
    <EventTalk5_6>Come on, kiddo!!! Let me teach you a lesson again!!!!</EventTalk5_6>
    <EventTalk5_7>Ah... How did he make this dragon so strong in such a short period of time?!... You must be lucky today!!</EventTalk5_7>
    <EventTalk5_8>If you want to prove that this wasn't a fluke,</EventTalk5_8>
    <EventTalk5_9>Come to the Colosseum!! There are people who are even stronger than me!!</EventTalk5_9>
    <EventTalk5_10>Prove that this wasn't just a fluke!!</EventTalk5_10>
    <EventTalk5_11>I will count the days until we meet again at the Colosseum, kid!</EventTalk5_11>
    <EventTalk5_12>- Cocky bastard... he is very strong...! -</EventTalk5_12>
    <EventTalk5_13>- You should train your dragon and prove yourself at the Colosseum!! -</EventTalk5_13>
    <EventTalk5_14>This is just as I predicted! You are no match for me!!</EventTalk5_14>
    <EventTalk5_15>I am heading over to the Colosseum to fight against other strong Dragon Tamers!</EventTalk5_15>
    <EventTalk5_16>Train your dragon and challenge me at the Colosseum. I would always welcome a rematch!</EventTalk5_16>
    <EventTalk5_17>Of course I will win... I guess if you challenge me a million times, you might win a fight. Haha.</EventTalk5_17>
    <EventTalk5_18>See you at the Colosseum!</EventTalk5_18>
    <EventTalk5_19>- Cocky bastard... you are certain that the Colosseum is full of strong Dragon Tamers like him...! -</EventTalk5_19>
    <EventTalk5_20>- You need to train a stronger dragon and prove your strength to him!!! -</EventTalk5_20>
    
    <EventTalk6_1>Were you trying to sneak into the Colosseum?&#10;You could've been in big trouble if it wasn't for me!!&#10;You need to register before entering the stadium!!</EventTalk6_1>
    <EventTalk6_2>It's very easy! You just have to write down a brief description of yourself!!</EventTalk6_2>
    <EventTalk6_3>It is impossible to participate in the event without registering first!</EventTalk6_3>
    <EventTalk6_4>This is a Dragon Tamer Certificate! Hurry up and fill out the paperwork!</EventTalk6_4>
    <EventTalk6_5>I would do it for you, but it is illegal to register others! So... get to it! Haha!</EventTalk6_5>
    <EventTalk6_6>Haha!!</EventTalk6_6>
    <EventTalk6A_7>Wow, you look different in this picture!!</EventTalk6A_7>
    <EventTalk6A_8>Did you Photoshop the picture?!</EventTalk6A_8>
    <EventTalk6A_9>...What does that even mean?</EventTalk6A_9>
    <EventTalk6A_10>I don't know, it's a popular phrase used in another world!!</EventTalk6A_10>
    <EventTalk6A_11>.............</EventTalk6A_11>
    <EventTalk6A_12>Anyway! We need to file your documents~ You can enter the Colosseum now!!</EventTalk6A_12>
    <EventTalk6A_13>Great job! See you later~!!!</EventTalk6A_13>
    <EventTalk6B_7>Don't forget to add your picture!!</EventTalk6B_7>
    <EventTalk6B_8>A photo that would be worthy of being my friend!!</EventTalk6B_8>

    <EventTalk6B_10>Haha~ thanks for the compliment!</EventTalk6B_10>

    <ZumunTalk3>You! You and Nuri! What's going on between two of you? Don't look at her like that!</ZumunTalk3>
    <ZumunTalk4>I'm bored....</ZumunTalk4>
    <ZumunTalk5>Tail got dirty.</ZumunTalk5>
    <ZumunTalk6>I wonder what Nuri is doing now.</ZumunTalk6>
    <ZumunTalk7>Hmm... secret to evolution.</ZumunTalk7>
    <ZumunTalk8>Knowledge makes you more confusing.</ZumunTalk8>
    
    <PopoTalk1>You seem to be in a good mood. Well, it's nice weather today!</PopoTalk1>
    <PopoTalk2>I'm worried about sudden increase of monsters around Elpis now days.</PopoTalk2>

    <UriaQuestClear1>Thank you. You have helped me greatly.</UriaQuestClear1>
    <UriaQuestClear2>I can complete my research with this. Thank you!</UriaQuestClear2>
    
    <DelisTalk1>Hmm... Dragon's Egg... dragon's egg... dragon... and an egg....</DelisTalk1>
    <DelisTalk2>If you're having hard time taming your dragon, just bring it over to the training center.</DelisTalk2>
    <DelisTalk3>I get really thrilled when I get a great dragon's egg. It's like I'm almost drooling over it!</DelisTalk3>
    <DelisTalk4>Dragon Egg is so nice.</DelisTalk4>
    <DelisTalk5>Round and round... oh, it's so beautiful!</DelisTalk5>
    <DelisTalk6>Drool... nope! I wasn't drooling!</DelisTalk6>
    <DelisTalk7>I really want to research Jimon.</DelisTalk7>
    <DelisTalk8>Where is my sister?</DelisTalk8>
    
    <RaonTalk1>What? What are you doing? Why are you just wandering around the village and not training?</RaonTalk1>
    <RaonTalk2>Well, ability like that, you'll never be a match for me. So maybe you are better off just wandering around!</RaonTalk2>
    <RaonTalk3>What? Why are you looking at me like that? Want to try me? Just get out of my sight, weakling!</RaonTalk3>
    <RaonTalk4>Oh, I'm so bored!</RaonTalk4>
    <RaonTalk5>Isn't there a worthy match for me?</RaonTalk5>
    <RaonTalk6>I will surely make my family rich!</RaonTalk6>
    <RaonTalk7>I need to make my dragon more powerful!</RaonTalk7>
    <RaonTalk8>Nope! I've no time for dumb dragon tamer!</RaonTalk8>
    
    <RaonQuest1>Every time I see you, you're always wasting time! And how can you call yourself my rival? Go and train, you weakling!</RaonQuest1>
    <RaonQuest2>Hmm... I wonder if this training is too much for you.</RaonQuest2>
    <RaonQuest3>That won't do if you want to beat me. How about training more!</RaonQuest3>
    <RaonQuestOk1>...I'm surprised! Alright! I'll wait for you!</RaonQuestOk1>
    <RaonQuestOk2>Puhaha! Come on! Fight like a worthy rival!</RaonQuestOk2>
    <RaonQuestCancel1>Well... didn't expect much from you, anyway!</RaonQuestCancel1>
    <RaonQuestCancel2>Ah... stop giving me excuses, you weakling!</RaonQuestCancel2>
    <RaonQuestClear1>Well... you got me this time.</RaonQuestClear1>
    <RaonQuestClear2>Stop smirking! You just got lucky one time!</RaonQuestClear2>
    
    <RaonHelp_Title>Ask Raon.</RaonHelp_Title>
    
    <RaonHelpMsg1>Do you need help?</RaonHelpMsg1>
    
    <RaonHelp1>What? You want me to do a favor for %1$s? I'm a busy man!</RaonHelp1>
    <RaonHelp2>You need another favor?</RaonHelp2>
    <RaonHelp3>Oh, it's getting hot. I don't think I can help you this time.</RaonHelp3>
    <RaonHelp4>You need another favor?</RaonHelp4>
    <RaonHelp5>And you really can't do it yourself?</RaonHelp5>
    
    <RaonHelpClear1>Well... if you're willing to pay this ... I think I can do it.</RaonHelpClear1>
    <RaonHelpClear2>This is great! I was running short of Diamonds because of new dragon I'm raising now days.</RaonHelpClear2>
    <RaonHelpClear3>It's not a bad trade. You are not dissatisfied with it, are you?</RaonHelpClear3>
    <RaonHelpClear4>Ha, ha. It's a piece of cake for me. Why? Too difficult for you?</RaonHelpClear4>
    
    <RuminiTalk1>...If you got something to sell, then come back later. I'm really busy now!</RuminiTalk1>
    <RuminiTalk2> There's no use in hanging around here. I've got nothing for you. Hey! What are you doing?</RuminiTalk2>
    <RuminiTalk3>I need a lot of money to cure my little sister. If you got no money, then don't talk to me!</RuminiTalk3>

    <DogiTalk2>Invasion by the Elves is really getting on my nerves! Those ugly and beastly looking beings!</DogiTalk2>
    <DogiTalk3>Man should know how to enjoy meat! It tastes good and digests well... yea, there's no substitute for it!</DogiTalk3>

    <NightTutorial_talk4>Jimon don't interrupt!!&#10;Ah, let's go to Elpis Village, where clock tower that changes night and day is located!</NightTutorial_talk4>

    <NightTutorial_talk8>Look! Scenary of Yutakan at night is great, right?&#10;Then I will explain to you about the night!</NightTutorial_talk8>
    <NightTutorial_talk9>More powerful monsters appear during nights!&#10;You see the level limits of the fields are now 50?</NightTutorial_talk9>
    <NightTutorial_talk10>They are more powerful so battles are longers, so you can explore only once! You can't continue any longer.</NightTutorial_talk10>
    <NightTutorial_talk11>And during adventure, you may meet gold imp and silver imp that have stolen treasures.&#10;If you collect those stolen treasures, you may be able to trade them for some nice stuff~</NightTutorial_talk11>

    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_0_0>Our queen ordered me to assist you. I'm honored by this opportunity because you are the greatest dragon tamer that the world has ever seen.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_0_0>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_0>Pilgrim of Light... That's a title only given to the noble ones who sacrificed greatly in the past.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_0>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_1>This is [Ellysium's Magic Shop]. It's quite different from the one in Yutakan.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_1>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_2>We have been studying skills of dragons for a long time. We wish to test the knowledge we have gained.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_2>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_3>Although god is kind, he sometimes is a negligent bystander. We often mistakenly call his negligence as 'devine test.'</SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_3>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_4>That broadsword has a very unique appearance. In fact, I believe I have never seen that material before... Very interesting.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_1_4>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_0>I hope that my research could be useful for you. Shall we start?</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_0>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_1>My daily fortune this morning was quite negative… Perhaps that's why I feel a bit tired. Hmm… Do you think it's just a superstition?</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_1>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_2>I heard plenty about you from Florence. That actually makes me quite jealous.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_2>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_3>I thought that dragons where legendary creatures with immense powers. Seeing a human taming such a powerful beast certainly is something to be amazed about.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_3>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_4>We still need more research about disintegrating scrolls. In that sense, we are going to need numerous skill scrolls.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_4>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_5>We were able to create skills thanks to Dersa's blessings.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_5>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_6>We only make skills in accordance with the method revealed by Dersa. We cannot create more skills.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_6>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_7>Diaz, the god of destiny has a guardian dragon called Aeuros. It must be a very powerful being.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_7>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_8>Florence sometimes travels to Metal Tower. I wonder who she is meeting there? Don't you think it's dangerous to go there?</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_8>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_9>Knot of delusion that comes from ignorance cannot be easily undone. Because of that, I must learn.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_9>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_10>I cannot fully comprehend the shadow casted upon your face... That shadow seems to be filled with endless sorrow.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_10>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_11>Why don't you go back to the village to organize yourself? It looks like your chin could use a shave.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_11>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_12>I'm skeptical about the cause of war between Elves and Dwarves. I believe that there is a third party involved in this war that could have started all this.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_12>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_13>I recented visited the Association of Magitek. A scholar named Mamo Ruddick seemed very eccentric, but also very knowledgeable.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_13>
    <SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_14>A magitek scholar named Annie seemed to have very deep undertanding about what she studies. However… the intelligence of someone who she likes did not seem adequate at all.</SkillLab_NpcTalk_2_14>
    <SkillLab_Break_Erro_1>There is no skill scroll to disintegrate.</SkillLab_Break_Erro_1>
    <SkillLab_Break_Erro_2>Insufficient gold for disintegration.</SkillLab_Break_Erro_2>
