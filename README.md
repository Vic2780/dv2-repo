NOTE: the visual portions of Dragon Village 2 animation assets are normally protected through encryption. as such, many assets in this repository were obtained through reverse engineering and decompiling source code. through downloading these assets, you acknowledge that the only way these assets could be sourced was through <i>violating highbrow's Terms of Service</i>, which explicitly forbids:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>reverse engineering, disassembling, or decompliling source code</li>
<li>defeating or overcoming game encryption technologies or security</li>
</ul>

if you intend to use these assets for personal github projects, i strongly recommend that you clone this repository and make copies in case it is taken down.
